with the august deadlines launch return to michigan pending and having gone down many digital rabbit holes most of which were not foreseen and only some of which were successful i find myself facing the realities of what i have how much time i have left and what i can still achieve and not be embarrassed of! this month was a bit of a back to basics month after my computer went on strike at the most inopportune moment about a month and a half ago i spent most of the time since my last blog reinstalling all the programs that i needed to get back on track  git adobe suite etc  at the same time i refreshed my memory about mapbox and cartodb  which we were introduced to last summer at the first installment of the dai  for some mapping of the field sites included in the database i eventually settled on mapbox for the relatively intuitive set up in the classical mode the interactive capabilities with pins labels and the easy functions for embedding and sharing  though i am still trying to sort out if it is possible to include a hyperlink in the pop-up label to transport user to further information – so if you have details please let me know!  screen captures of the mapbox project for the monumental archive project  click for interactive map   along with the database and the controlled variables the primary building blocks of the website are slowly coming together somewhat scaled back from original visions and slightly less high tech the website will still keep the primary goals of providing user-friendly open access data and a place to discuss contemporary approaches to cemetery research when it comes down to it the bells and whistles aren't nearly as important as the function of sharing data and the message that monument data should really be open access the next couple months will be focussed on building the final frameworks for the function of the website making the database live and accessible and setting the stage for what i’m sure will be a much longer process than originally hoped for so this is a classic tim gunn ‘make it work’ moment – nose to the grindstone and see what comes out in a few months,
in a post in august i introduced the concept for the monumental archive project  map  an open database of historic cemeteries as a means of encouraging much needed data reuse and sustainable practice as well as creativity and collaboration in this area of research it outlined a plan for a website that would provide a platform for the curation of data user-friendly access and interactive collaboration whilst in michigan surrounded by extremely talented mentors who make even the most complicated programming problems look like child’s play that plan looked easily achievable upon realizing that on my own my skills were not quite up to snuff and finding myself completely bewildered by the process of building this monumental ‘thing’ i spent the fall putting myself through digital training while i am a strong proponent for jumping right in i decided to take the tactic of jumping into smaller ponds before i jumped into a big one epicurio - a digital resource for an edible curiosity cabinet created for the heritage jam  i learned about the blogging world and the twitter world  both of which i’m now passing on to my fourth year students  i tackled some more coding courses  now working on python which is about as scary as the name implies  and perhaps most notably i entered the university of york’s heritage jam 2015 – an event that brings people together to design and create forward-thinking pieces of heritage visualisation in a short space of time inspired by the theme for 2015 ‘museums and collections’ and discussions from the dai in august regarding the role of technology in broadening access to more experiential heritage i designed and built epicurio – a website that provides all the inspiration and directions to build an edible cabinet of curiosities so that you can not only see the archaeological record but also make it pick it up and eat it to experience the textures tastes and smells of the past while the project was a lot of fun merging my interests in archaeology and baking eating more importantly i learned to build a website in three days it wasn’t quite from the ground up – i modified a bootstrap theme as a framework and used github’s gh-pages to host it for free i could easily have just worked on a small-scale project privately but the very public nature of the heritage jam added some much needed pressure to be productive and to make things work in a short period of time with the value of feedback from a group of very impressive folks my efforts were kindly rewarded with a judges’ choice award so i couldn’t be more honoured that my participation was well received  =attachment_2545 style=width  853px  aligncenter>screenshot of the map website - a work in progress  these mini challenges for myself have not meant that map has been completely on the back burner but there is only so much to be said about cleaning data and then cleaning data some more i have also been actively advocating for open data amongst archaeologists recording cemeteries while it has been well-received in theory this has not resulted in any new datasets presently for the time being map will focus on creating a proof of concept using data that i have collected in barbados with the hopes of then expanding with further north american datasets once people can visualise the system as a real platform for preservation and exposure the challenges that i am currently working on     building the website that will stand as the front-end interface for engaging with the data;user-friendly formats for presenting controlled vocabularies – because the map will welcome the contribution of datasets but is premised on comparative data it will be important to standardize categories of monuments iconography text etc and to present those standards in accessible ways there are not strong standards in monument recording so establishing and promoting controlled vocabularies will be crucial to the success of this endeavour i would also be interested if anyone can help me with suggestions for free  and straightforward  analytics software i was unsuccessful in establishing any analytics for the epicurio website i attempted to incorporate google analytics into the code as well as some other free online software however none of these seemed to function properly  probably a reflection of me more than anything  while i used twitter and social media to gage some of the use of the website measuring usage and interaction with map will be much more important i don’t think that i need to set myself any specific new year’s resolutions to continue to challenge myself digitally in 2016; the plans i set in motion for map in 2015 have ensured that this year will be both exciting and stimulating so stay tuned for updates on crafting an open access database engaging with the dead in digital formats and the hiccups that spring up along the way and in the meantime set your own digital challenges,
the digital catalog of cappadocian ceiling crosses will be a deposit of my dissertation data into open context and kora repositories and will be visualized into a public-facing catalog using the matrix connect wordpress plugin the project plan was pretty straightforward… data  collect —&gt; clean —&gt; deposit —&gt; visualize  = project! piece o’ cake surely ha there are lots of ‘moving parts’ that need to be sorted out in order to deliver this little bundle of digital joy into the archaeo world most crucial is that the data must be completely collected and fact checked alongside the writing and editing of my dissertation chapters this is do-able but not quick luckily as conversations ebb and flow on twitter and the digital archaeology commons there’s downtime i’ve had a chance to let the project simmer a bit in between conversations with faculty mentors and these ideas were bubbling on the back burner while other deadlines loomed and i awaited a grant decision taking advantage of these lulls between conversations i’ve honed in on the topic of identity with particular epiphanies highlighted in bold below this topic was shimmering on the surface because each project needs some sort of identity and that was an important theme in the project vision document but it’s closely wrapped up in other identities as well for instance i went to the institute last year as a cuny graduate center student but i plan to graduate this spring which means that i have absolutely no idea what institutional affiliations i will have come august this began as a student project augmenting my dissertation work building something progressive alongside the more traditional threads of scholarship i’ve been doing in required departmental work but it will possibly be my first project launch as a phd feedback from mentors on logistics made me realize that a clearly defined project and its public identity are not the same thing in fact i realized along the way of doing a separate digital project called documenting cappadocia over the last four years that breaking it into discreet projects with their own identities could have benefits for both funding and sanity as deadlines and deliverables loom documenting cappadocia was my first foray into digital scholarship built in the new media lab with minimal funding and maximum flexibility into how i wanted to shape and pitch the project and so i dreamed big—a multi-faceted site for both academics and the public; lots of images and maps and essays; a vibrant community of people wanting to comment and contribute in retrospect this is hilarious no project can be all things to all people especially with a niche topic like byzantine cappadocia however i’m very glad that i tried branching out into a few different areas because i was able to see which were working and which ones needed to be geared toward a different format or a audience most of the attention it has received has been from researchers wanting images of a particular monument or travel bloggers interested in the location data so now i’m committed to using that site as a scholarly introduction to the area  that’s my tagline  and to literally document cappadocia—with photo galleries encyclopedia-style essays a map and a bibliography this can be useful to people who are traveling to the region and want some background into the history and to scholars and students who need to be pointed into the direction of reliable secondary sources the blog is about the actual process of documenting that is reflections and tutorials on digital humanities and archaeological methods and tools used to do this kind of work making these decisions was useful but left my dissertation data about specific architectural details  a catalog of 50 monuments images and their metadata  out in the cold and here’s where msudai comes in i realized that this project is more than a spin-off of documenting cappadocia it’s an entity that needs its own scholarly and visual identity it makes sense as a capstone project because it’s fairly well-defined and constrained enough that it’s a feasible milestone but now that the project is defined there’s still the stand-alone identity for the dc_ccc as i’ve nicknamed it in my notes to contend with  side note  does that even work? dc ccc or dcccc or dc-ccc were all a bit awkward  here are some key areas for developing the project’s identity   outreach  i received a provost’s digital innovation grant from cuny that funds an initiative to bring cappadocian work to an open audience through a loosely networked collection of digital projects this allows me to have a variety of projects under the umbrella of cappadocia on the commons and give them each a distinct identity one of those is the dc_ccc terry’s institute discussion on social media is one that i’ve been mulling over in a variety of ways he encouraged me to consider business accounts for social media because of the more robust analytics and i’ve done that for pinterest i’ll be experimenting with outreach to public audiences through that channel over the year and will report back  visual identity  to do this kind of outreach—i can’t always bring myself to call it branding but it’s definitely related—i’ve been developing a visual identity for the dc_ccc i want to have distinctive visuals including a logo or avatar i’ve been watching some skillshare videos and tutorials on logos and branding  a flash-back to my previous incarnation as a graphic designer  and sketching while i’m trying not to get carried away with spin-off projects i do wonder if this catalog could be a model for others in a series  a digital catalog of ethiopian ceiling crosses or of cappadocian red paintings for instance  audience and discipline  the dc_ccc is a fairly narrow project and one geared toward a scholarly audience one issue is how to honor the project as something discreet and special while acknowledging it as an extension of my work my academic and professional persona my collaborations and affiliations another is how to make it user-focused when the potential audience will likely be quite small perhaps the most existential question is how pitching this specifically as archaeology data affects both process and outcome for one thing it pushes my techy skills to new realms  cleaning data implementing linked data and controlled vocabularies are issues my faculty mentors have already brought up it certainly expands the audience to people who will be interested in the methods if not the subject matter yesterday i was at the metropolitan museum of art’s watson library looking at pretty exhibition catalogs and admitted to myself that i want the end result of this to be an aesthetically pleasing catalog a digital interactive elegant useful straightforward pretty catalogue raisonné the traditional gold standard for collated art historical data my knee-jerk reaction was to feel a bit sheepish about emphasizing aesthetics but truthfully this is in some ways playing to my strengths—i’m trained as an art historian and a publication designer so that’s a comfortable object to envision as an end goal that actually leads to one take-away i have from this month’s msudai work and reading other posts  we’ll spend a lot of time pushing our skills limits and learning new things  which is great!  but playing to one’s strengths is also a skill we shouldn’t forget to calculate what we already know as an asset to the project and now i’m more confident that bringing the old-school museum catalog to archaeological data merges the best of what these fields  art history archaeology museum studies digital humanities  have to offer it’s an argument for interdisciplinarity for fieldwork training to be more widely available in art history graduate programs and for spaces as objects and artifacts al mcmichael @byzcapp  phd candidate in art history  the graduate center of the city university of new york  cuny,
it has been close to two weeks since i left msu’s institute for digital archaeology method and practice and my mind is still on information overload from all the tools techniques and new technologies i acquired while attending it my name is stacey camp and i currently serve a dual role at the university of idaho; i am a director of one of three state archaeological repositories in idaho  the alfred w bowers laboratory of anthropology  and i also am an associate professor of anthropology this institute helped me recharge my batteries since undergoing a number of substantial academic transitions since late 2013 which include taking over the directorship of the lab in late fall 2013 receiving tenure in the summer of 2013 and taking a sabbatical during the fall 2014 these transitions have made me seek out alternative ways of communicating and disseminating archaeological knowledge which is why i was very excited to hear that i was accepted into this neh institute  i have always been intrigued by the confluence of technology and archaeology i am especially interested in how technology can tease out new interpretations of data as well as how it can be utilized as a tool for public outreach as a graduate student at stanford i took coursework on gis and learned how to use gis to do predictive modeling on archaeological sites i also designed and coded a website on my doctoral research during my sabbatical last year i started to take my work in new directions by exploring how virtual and augmented worlds can be used as a way of engaging others in the process of archaeological interpretation i am heading on my second year of coursework in the university of idaho’s virtual technology and design program and am working on a prototype of an interactive virtual world on wwii internment with a team of designers as i write  despite having some knowledge of the different ways technology can be applied to archaeological work this institute made me aware of the very diverse broad spectrum of technologies that exist perhaps the hardest thing about learning about new ways of conducting archaeological work was figuring out what i should do for my institute project like most archaeologists and directors of museums and archaeological repositories i have so many projects and to-do lists on my desk  well actually on my trello to-do lists!  where should i start? what are our priorities as a state repository? what absolutely needs to be communicated and what can wait? what can lighten our sometimes burdensome workload? these thoughts ran through my mind as i sat through the first day of the institute i came with a plan to develop a mobile-friendly website highlighting one of our particularly unique archaeological collections and that immediately changed once i made it through the first week of the institute i realized that i needed to prioritize disseminating information about our archaeological repository’s holdings one of the biggest challenges we face as a repository is managing our diverse workload and numerous publics we put a lot of time into outreach in particular which is part of our lab’s mission as a state repository public outreach involves giving tours to university students faculty administrators and staff developing an annual interactive exhibit at our local latah county fair hosting open houses at our lab and coordinating an annual event for idaho archaeology month in may here is a sample of our legislation that articulates this role   =attachment_2464 style=width  310px  aligncenter>university of idaho's alfred w bowers laboratory legislation  my project for msu’s institute for digital archaeology method and practice is therefore going to consist of two components  1  a website that displays the northern counties that our repository encompasses and the collections associated with each county  with permission from collection owners when necessary  and 2  a mobile-friendly website that would allow visitors to tour some of our showcase collections in the repository both components of our project will also free up my time and my employees’ time we answer emails and phone calls regarding the extent of our holdings and frequently give tours of our lab to campus administrators students faculty and classes an interactive map that provides links to our holdings as well as an interactive online tour of our facility and some of its collections will not replace us but will rather augment and add to the valuable work we do for our state collection owners and region although i coded as a teen  back when we had apple iies!  and authored some websites in high school college and graduate school i haven’t experimented with javascript and jquery this project is taking me out of my technological comfort zone but i know it will be a valuable experience that i can draw upon for future lab and research projects as well as for course instruction i have a stack of coding books being delivered to my office tomorrow and i am looking forward to diving in and learning how to code these projects from scratch  and with the help of our project mentors! ,
i am maria bruno assistant professor of anthropology archaeology at dickinson college in carlisle pennsylvania i specialize in the analysis of macrobotanical remains from archaeological sites in the andes and amazon basin of south america in doing so i aim to learn about how humans interact with their environments to create productive landscapes for food production as a graduate student i focused on tools and technologies that helped me collect identify and analyze plants from archaeological contexts i developed a filemaker database to organize my data and i had friends help me make maps in arcgis of the sites the samples came from and to illustrate different environmental variables in the study region while i was able to manage these tools enough to complete my thesis and present the information in publications and presentations i have been feeling frustrated by the limits of my digital skills in the past few years i have arrived at a point where i want to use digital tools to address new questions in my research and share information more readily with colleagues students and the communities with which i work when i received the advertisement for the institute on digital archaeology method and theory at michigan state university i applied hoping that this could be the opportunity to get up to speed i was quite happy to be accepted as one of the unfunded attendees and was very fortunate to have gained support from a dickinson college digital humanities development grant the institute ended up being even more than i imagined! the tools that fall under digital archaeology are incredible from innovative database construction and sharing to creating games and augmented reality that not only provide a fun way to learn about archaeology but also help archaeologists test hypotheses about the past as we learned about each of these tools i could envision how i could use each of them! although i got very excited about many possibilities i have my project for this year quite focused because i know the learning curve will be steep for me i came to the institute wanting to learn about technologies that would help me with the current stage of research taking place as part of the taraco archaeological project directed by dr christine hastorf at the university of california berkeley christine and i have recently been working on projects that deal with the broader taraco landscape on one hand we are interested in the very physical permutations of the landscape and how plant animal and human communities changed as the climate fluctuated between wetter and drier periods on the other hand we are also interested in how the landscape is lived and perceived by the people who inhabit it in order to accomplish these goals we need digital maps that not only help us illustrate and analyze the landscape but that are accessible to the people who live and interact with it today i have proposed to create an interactive webmapping site that will allow users to explore the landscapes of the taraco peninsula through a variety of maps which illustrate natural and cultural features of the region across space and time visitors will be able to click through different types of maps of the peninsula  topographic geological soils and vegetation  to learn about the environmental variables with which human communities interact they will also be able to explore how these features relate to human elements of the peninsula such as the location of current communities well-known archaeological sites roads and fields readers can follow my blog as i spend the next year playing around with the tools that i will be using to create this site i was very inspired by the great webmapping project developed by msu graduate student katy meyers callled ieldran she modified a webmapping template called bootleaf developed by bryan mcbride i plan to fork her program from github and learn how to create my own by modifying what she made i might also play around with mapbox cartodb and qgis as i mentioned above this institute has been much more than i ever envisioned it has me doing things that i never thought i’d do such as coding and making video games! while some of these tasks are a bit daunting i’m excited to be learning new skills even though my role has changed from student to professor each month i plan to post the progress i’ve made and mostly likely share the trials of learning these news skills hopefully i can also get some feedback from the readers,
this phase of the dc_ccc was the opposite of fieldwork nothing says open access digital resource like combing through out-of-print books for data right? but on the upside i got to spend two weeks at dumbarton oaks a research institute for byzantine studies that provided me with a short-term residency to finish researching my dissertation on monumental ceiling crosses in cappadocia turkey several of the books that are foundational to cappadocian studies are incredibly hard to find so having them all on one desk in a research library was a treat i also got to spend a lot of quality time there with my msudai spreadsheet editing and fact-checking my master list of ceiling crosses their metadata and where they’ve been published reining in the bibliography  =attachment_2949 style=width  310px  alignright>all seven volumes of guilluame de jerphanion's work on cappadocia on one desk nerd heaven  i spent many hours thumbing through heavy volumes on cappadocian monuments  many for the third of fourth time  making sure i had documented each published ceiling cross and and noting the author book and pages of each one collecting a bibliography for each ceiling cross was published required a surprisingly tricky decision making process i have over 70 ceiling crosses now so researching each monument thoroughly could take a great deal of time and might not be worth it and in many cases scholars have published the monument but didn’t mention the ceiling cross so i came up with a short list of usual suspects for the catalog’s bibliography—volumes by well-respected scholars that catalogue a number of cappadocian monuments or have had a significant impact on the field i combed through each of those and noted in my spreadsheet the pages of any monument that has a ceiling cross or that discusses monuments i know to have a ceiling cross  even if it isn’t mentioned  i will augment this bibliography with publications or monographs that discuss other monuments with ceiling crosses but this gives me a foundational bibliography to rely on the usual suspects list is a good starting point for people who would want to research these monuments it isn’t exhaustive but it’s adequate i keep having to remind myself  scope creep kills!  projects that is  and this is a project about monument data not exhaustive bibliographies hacking the spreadsheet  another decision i made was to have only one master list spreadsheet i’d tossed around the idea of having monuments with their bibliography on one and monuments with their metadata on another that got vetoed pretty quickly when i started finding new  to me  ceiling crosses adding to the list at this stage of the game meant i really needed only one list this probably means i need to learn about various sheets in excel  or similar  but conquering my fear of spreadsheets once and for all was my actual goal here frustrations with spreadsheets  i love a well-organized archive but using rows and columns is not intuitive i’m a post-its and mind maps kind of thinker so it took all my willpower to just keep typing in those tiny boxes making the spreadsheet into a useful tool for me that worked visually as well as structurally was key so i made some temporary customizations a few things that helped me see the spreadsheet in ways i could wrap my head around on the fly while i was simultaneously poring over books in french first was color-coding various rows all rows for monuments in the ihlara valley are in blue for instance i also added in some blank rows to separate groups of monuments and i added a row under the top list of column names describing each column so that i would remember what the abbreviations meant i changed the font sizes for various columns making the monument’s names bigger and categories i wasn’t working on smaller i gave myself permission to just add ??? when the data needed checking i also made a column for random notes to myself and spent a lot of time watching tutorials online about moving rows and columns  which can be tricky actually  some of these are probably the opposite of best practice for data recording but i’m using them as training wheels for my spreadsheet and when i clean up the data i’ll clean up the spreadsheet as well  i’ve saved backup copies of the file after every major addition to the spreadsheet  it’s funny—so many tutorials on working with data assume you’ve got a complete usable data set and skip over the collection and cleaning part yet that’s where i’ve always had the most trouble so having made decisions and recorded the information leaves me at a surprisingly satisfying stage of the project as for the monuments’ metadata taking the currently-slightly-messy data and cleaning it to work in dublin core with my own ‘local’ additions is now entirely possible issues tackled   scattered info  now all in one spreadsheet   fear of spreadsheets  training wheels visual elements i can clean up later   bibliography issue  limit to usual suspects add other important articles books on a case by case basis   monuments multiplying like gremlins  have a cut-off date for adding to the catalog  issues ongoing   images  not sure whether i should can include them do i redraw architectural plans? do sketches? have different images for various monuments? use thumbnails?   cleaning data  use dublin core figure out how to augment dublin core with my local elements   using spreadsheets like a grown-up  tbd  a takeaway from this month’s research is how much data collection is like writing  just because the initial data is messy doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong as with writing the thing needs to exist before you can edit it to make it better both writing and data collection are kinds of knowledge production hopefully over time a personalized workflow for data collection and writing become more organized more efficient over time it’s about the research questions not the tools a second delightful realization was that these awkward spreadsheet columns will be so much more functional as interactive categories in my final project you’ll be able to see the monuments in one category with a click and then reorganize them into another category to answer a different research question it’s nice to see the project starting to emerge from the mess,
forgive me fellow digital archaeologists for i have sinned i am a week late in my msu dai blog post at the time of the deadline i was in the throes of my phd thesis viva  aka defense  and was wholly and completely entrenched in the process however given that the basis for my msu dai project is based in part on my thesis project the process re-centered my focus on why i am doing this my digital project was inspired by a concern with the practice of recording cemetery monuments but never sharing the  records despite their historical value this was at least in part informed by my doctoral research experience during which i became increasingly aware of those that had come before me there were partial records online and in the islands archives there were rumours of other archaeologists ‘doing the same thing as me’ last month last season last year  =attachment_2999 style=width  1034px  aligncenter>fieldwork in st andrew's churchyard barbados 2013  at the same time since starting this project i have had many voice their concerns about sharing my database before i have published ‘everything i intend to publish’ for fear of others swooping in and stealing my thunder however if i did wait until the point at which i had extracted every last piece of publishable narrative from the database before letting any one else get access to it i would likely face retirement or even my own mortality without sharing it i genuinely believe that this database and others like it can be used in so many different ways and by so many different people i find it altogether unlikely that anyone will ask the same questions in the same ways  which of course is a primary argument for proponents of open data and open access more generally  during my viva as we discussed plans for publication i was struck by the fact that there was no discussion of data sharing access and public engagement but rather academic venues and interpretive narratives having discussed this issue with other recent phd students i found that many had a similar experience  though happily there were some exceptions  i think this is a missed opportunity to engage early career archaeologists in discussions of impact public engagement and contemporary publishing practices getting back to my msu dai project i spent some time on the transatlantic flight home ruminating on the public nature usability and framing of the web-based platform to ensure that my goals were still aligned with my methods although i have had to put data archiving on the back burner until i have funding and have adjusted the scope of the database to be achievable at this time the values of open data relevance to wider audiences and connections between data and research are still heavily at the core of my project by next blog i hope to have more of the website built and accessible for feedback including the controlled vocabulary section and research forum,
i am mary lennon from aecom's cultural resource management  crm  office in burlington nj i will be doing a project based on one of our most recent excavations before i can announce the particulars there are a few conversations that need to happen with our client i will update you all in the very near future;stay tuned! for now i can tell you that this project aims to connect our client  who wishes to fund-raise to do additional work  the general public and a group of interested scholars to each other through the artifacts found at the site the goal is to explore how to best connect artifacts to the location where they were found and the public while creating and maintaining a dialog will last longer than a news article or paper report the project at present intends to take form as a website that will include an interactive map and dynamically linked artifact inventory i can't wait to announce the rest! mary,
hello i’m jolene smith and i manage data for archaeological sites at the virginia department of historic resources  dhr  over the next year i’ll be working on creating a digital repository for gray literature photos and other files in our collections since we’ve got so much to work with i decided to narrow down my dataset to materials that i classify as low risk high interest in doing so i can focus my attention on creating a front-end webpage for this repository that presents interesting archaeological information to the non-professional general public additionally i’m going to apply the principles of linked open data in order to integrate this material with virginia data already available through the fantastic dinaa project and open context for a lot of organizations making something like this would be fairly straightforward but operating within state government brings a lot of constraints protecting sensitive site locations is always an issue for us but so is network security because of this i’m limited in my choices of software and hosted services i’m fully expecting to have to get quite creative to work within the requirements of  my agency but that’s part of the fun  this is a big project that could get very complicated i’m eager to see how it changes shape as i work with agency colleagues institute mentors and as i really dig into development sticking to scope will be a challenge but weekly blogging will be a great help toward keeping me on the right track in the end my hope is that this project will lay a firm foundation for a full digital repository for dhr data that can be accessed by people doing standard compliance-driven archaeology in virginia as well as researchers in the state and beyond we will also have a robust public web resource representing archaeology in virginia and introducing new concepts and exciting material to lay audiences i’m aiming high next week i’ll be meeting with colleagues at dhr to lay out my proposal and to make sure my vision aligns with agency needs requirements and workflow as i shift to slicing-and-dicing project management mode i’m looking forward to feedback from my agency and from institute faculty to make this an achievable and sustainable project,
last month i wrote about how stuck i was and set out a path to move forward in light of my technical frustrations this month i made a little progress; i wish i made more but the truth is i was focused more on securing permissions for my dissertation research and preparing my session at the society for american archaeology conference i have a domain and a basic wordpress setup going at the domain for the pocumtuck heritage website my supervisor has provided me with sample images of objects we can use as entry points on the front page each of these objects lives on its own page and will be accompanied by related bits of information from historical archaeological and stakeholder sources at this stage i am mining the materials i prepared for my doctoral exam on the connecticut river valley's archaeology for those bits i'm trying not to over-edit myself  a bad habit of the dissertation writer  while i identify compelling relatable content the key will be to summarize or quote each bit in less than 3 sentences so that users building a narrative will not be intimidated or bored by too much text during this process i am also revisiting some of the heritage literature relating to historical narrative construction i am finding the article reading the visual  representation and narrative in the construction of heritage and literature on aesthetic representation in art history  reading from a course with dr pamela smart  especially useful reflecting on my plan in light of these i need to think further about how to encourage the user to interact with the meanings and interpretations i am urging them to attach to the decontextualized objects i am presenting narrative construction is not necessarily desired by casual observers of archaeology or even avocational archaeologists; objects may be viewed and appreciated aesthetically economically or as reflections of one's own values there must be further incitement to inspire the user to build a story i am not sure what to do with this yet but i plan to explore these ideas further when i begin building the wordpress theme one step at a time lastly i checked in a lot this month with other participants in the msudai and i found it very rewarding to share resources with them even if all we could offer one another was an encouraging comment i am hoping that in the coming months i can have an in-person or virtual group work day so we can all make a push toward finishing our projects our community is stronger together and i am hoping we use that sense of community to push each of us through bumps in the road,
this past month has been yet another 4 weeks of discoveries and introspection for my project since writing about using adobe muse for my lab’s archaeological repository website i have been ruminating on the theme of accessibility when i struggled to get a mobile-first website up and working through adobe muse a light bulb went on in my head i realized that if i am struggling with the process then imagine how difficult it will be for someone who might take place as director to build upon the work i have done with our lab website adobe muse was helpful for laying out the design of our front facing website but it isn’t a good fit for designing a display for our digitized content and collections after attending a workshop on scalar and listening to noted digital humanities and social sciences scholar dr tara mcpherson’s talk at washington state university i realized that sustainability and accessibility are the two themes that really need to guide and inform my work what i am doing now is going to shape future work in my lab; if done properly my digital project will make future directors’ jobs easier  or at least more logical  if we are going to put a lot of work into scanning and digitizing collections we need to make sure that whatever system we adopt is sustainable and accessible to our employees and future collection managers and directors i do not want to replicate or reinvent the wheel when it comes to a content management system for digitized data if we can move data into an existing content management system  cms  and have control and say over what is forward vs backward-facing in terms of data then we don’t need to develop a website separate from our content management system so where does this leave me? i am moving forward with three different projects first i started learning bootstrap to develop my own personal website and get the coding experience i wanted from this neh institute the website is under major construction but is currently being hosted by reclaim at http   wwwstaceylcampnet homehtml second i am developing a front-facing website that highlights some information about our lab  eg public outreach broad outline of our holdings links to our social media etc  using bootstrap which will link to the third project the third project is bringing our collections into mukurtu mukurtu will allow us to protect sacred cultural knowledge about collections and control who has access to certain aspects of our collections i chose mukurtu because our neighboring institution  6 miles from the university of idaho  houses it and we can go to them for help and training this brings me back to the theme of accessibility and sustainability my staff and i will undergo training to learn mukurtu so it won’t be something only the director of the lab can access and use it will be sustainable because it is housed at our neighboring institution where future staff of our lab can easily visit for training on mukurtu the next month will be spent developing all three of these projects and i look forward to sharing those developments with the public ,
keep it manageable! since receiving this good advice from project mentors i’ve been mulling how to focus our banda through time public-focused heritage web site and pilot digital repository in a way that keeps the project manageable at the same time as demonstrates its potential for community engagement working together with veronique plante an ma student at the university of victoria i’m still in the process of delimiting a narrower scope for the pilot repository but in the meantime we’ve made good progress in inventorying collating and digitizing prospective resources in october i traveled to the university of washington to meet with rené bravmann an art historian who undertook research in the banda area in the late 1960s he has kindly agreed to include photos from his work in the repository and generously allowed me to return to victoria with a collection of slides and negatives that we are in process of digitizing hours have been spent reviewing the contents of my slide collection and selecting examples for cleaning and scanning we are mindful that in selecting images crafting metadata and developing a narrative frame for the web portal we are engaged in a process of archive- and history-making so too are we mindful of the need to consult with banda constituencies a process made difficult by the fact that we’re engaged in this work on a pacific-rim island far from banda! but plans are underway for a june trip to ghana during which i’ll be meeting with banda traditional authorities and community members to discuss proposed content progress to date and directions for the work i’ve also initiated dialogue with archaeology colleagues in ghana about initiatives we might pilot aimed at developing stable digital archives for archaeological research that has been conducted in ghana again i’m mindful of the need to keep my digital archaeology institute activities focused so as to have tangible results by august but i’m also keen to ensure that those results are scalable and thus lay the foundation for longer-term and sustainable digital resources having recently attended a session on data management strategies hosted by our university library and participated in an saa webinar on data management strategies i’m increasingly focused in my role as department chair on ways that we can build these issues into our departmental curriculum and mulling the steps we need to take to ensure long-term preservation and access to our research data,
my name is ann stahl and i chair the department of anthropology at the university of victoria in british columbia canada since 1986 i’ve coordinated the banda research project  brp  which centers on how villagers in the banda area of west central ghana have engaged shifting global entanglements these include involvement in the saharan trade from about 1200 ce; the effects of an intensifying atlantic trade from the early 18th century; the imposition of british colonial rule at the end of the 19th century; and the unfolding situation associated with the recent construction by the chinese firm sinohydro of a hydroelectric dam on the black volta river the latter is bringing people from across ghana and the world to a place that was until recently in ghana lingo considered a ‘dead-end place’—one where transport ended but which of course has had a long and dynamic history,
archaeologists historians genealogists community groups and cemetery enthusiasts all over the world have recognized the historical value of gravestones for studying identity social relationships tradition practice and choice grief and emotion self-representation symbolism trade and craft production – the possibilities are endless  =attachment_2337 style=width  1034px  aligncenter>crowded cemeteries are rich historical resources  as a phd student working in historic cemeteries in the united kingdom canada and the caribbean i have repeatedly faced the same problem  there are a lot of people doing great work recording funerary monuments but very little access to the data afterwards this limits historical research by restricting sample size and comparative studies but it also results in the constant repetition of work that has already been done a rich historical record already exists if only it was accessible the monumental archive project  map  will act as an open database of historic cemeteries to address accessibility and sustainability issues whilst stimulating creativity it will act to ,
gravestones tombstones grave markers memorials monuments commemoration tablet ledger headstone footstone plaque slab mausoleum crypt obelisk stele cenotaph last week i received an email from a colleague asking about terminology and preferences in using gravestone vs headstone vs monument vs memorial this discussion in itself is complex but it is also just touching on issues of categorizing monuments at the largest scale – within any particular style of monument there are innumerable variations that reveal important information about practice fashion tradition identity and emotion in the past in the world of commemoration vocabulary seems endless and the task of selecting terms that are communicative to wide audiences but also reflect localized practice is truly monolithic in nature not to mention the historical context of research the politics in referencing art history- archaeology- and history-based work and the relationship between academic heritage management and public endeavours  =attachment_2744 style=width  910px  aligncenter>examples of classification of style and decoration of monuments  shape contours moulding and decoration  the sheer variety of commemorative material culture both temporally and geographically contributes to the challenges selecting a term that is contextually specific is valuable for regional or localized micro-narratives however it makes comparison and bigger picture studies nearly impossible this is the type of research that i have been undertaking in the atlantic world and the complications in combining datasets from colonies and metropoles inspired the original conceptualisation of the monumental archive project given the range of open access databases of monuments available  findagrave canadianheadstones etc  linked and contextual data is what sets map apart in addition to efforts underway to ensure long-term preservation of digital data however it is still the component that i find most bewildering it is comparatively easy to tinker with website design and programming issues because it seems more neutral and far less political than approaching the touchy subject of controlled vocabularies and linked data  here i will piggyback off of al mcmichael’s excellent discussion of naming conventions in another msu dai blog this month  the good news is that after letting these issues percolate and dance around me for months now along with the wise words of my mentors my goals have finally become clearer as the little picture and the big picture and the path between them my goals for our august launch deadline with the msu dai     craft a functioning web platform to serve as a hub for the mapsaas or shas in 2017 – stay tuned and contact me if this is of interest ads at the university of york to ensure long term preservation  in the next month i will work on solidifying my plans for the collaborative platform within map including exploring which technologies to use how to set it up and begin refining the framework of this component,
i am now happily generating csv exports of data from the mnhs collections management system thanks to a bit of additional help from keith maguire of south australian museum who wrote the original xslt report for me! my test data set is officially ready for publication in open context i shared the data set with one of dr hayes’ students so she can start working on her analysis i plan to show her how to access and use the data in open content once it is available there also at matt cassady’s recommendation i have started reading over research assembled by the historic sites staff regarding the daily life of soldiers at the fort during the nineteenth century this will help me better understand the significance of the artifact patterns we are seeing much to my surprise dr hayes came out to fort snelling on march 3rd with a university of minnesota staff member who supports the use of technology in research and education they brought a new 360 degree camera to test on the fort snelling short barracks part of the scanning  or is it filming?  included shots of interiors populated with reproduction artifacts this opens the possibility that we could link these objects to information about actual artifacts found during excavation of that building i have little idea how to accomplish this once i gain access to the files but plan to do some research to see if i can find sites using this kind of interface next steps include trying my hand at basic website construction so i can begin to understand how i might connect my data with an interface,
over the past few months since the msu dai workshop ended lisa and i have been hemming and hawing about our ossuarykb project we were hitting road-blocks in design functionality and audience- unable to get a solid idea of how exactly the entire project would work what tools we would use and how this would appeal to stakeholders but then we realized the problem  the project that we really wanted to make a tool for the public to learn more about mortuary archaeology was not what we were actually doing so we are changing things up and producing something that we are passionate about and really think will be an asset in today’s digital landscape we are proud to announce… tomb  the online map of bioarchaeology  increasingly the public is becoming interested in human remains in the past however there is no single place that they can go to for a simplified education on the topic that hasn’t been created by popular media this site will act as a resource for the public students educators and scholars alike it will provide transparency about the use of human remains for research and show the diverse range of research and locations where this is occurring using pleiades and atlas obscura as exemplars for the site construction we will be creating an interactive map of case studies and examples from mortuary archaeology and bioarchaeology the purpose of this site is to provide a place for students and the public to learn more about the amazing diversity of mortuary research that is occurring in the world but also about variation in funerary methods it will also serve as a place for anthropologists to share their research on these topics and provides updates on what it occurring in the broader study the project will begin by adding sites from around the world that are organized based on broad topics such as type of disposal type of research period location researchers etc it will primarily be based around a map interface that will allow users to select certain variables for exploring mortuary sites such as type of disposal research done period cultural affiliation etc each site can be selected to view more detailed information about who completed the research and what has been written about it the goal is to provide a brief overview of each site the site will be based on a combination of bootstrap and leaflet and will pull data from a geojson file for the first iteration of the project we will have a selection of five different types of burials and five different foci in bioarchaeology and mortuary archaeology users will be able to search for specific themes like paleopathology and learn about where this research is going on or look up disposal types like cremation and see where and when this practice is in use in addition to this we will have resources on the site for users to learn the background of this type of study where to learn more and how to integrate this into teaching and education we are excited for this development in our project and are looking forward to creating tomb,
i consider myself careful with data records making data usable for open-source gis has meant considering more than the benefits of a particular gis program my short-term goals  for the institute for digital archaeology project  are to develop a pilot project to move some of my gis data  not open source  from the underwater maya project longer-term goals are deciding whether to move more  all?  of my underwater gis data to an open source gis i also want to consider how to design the gis for the next phase of fieldwork  do i continue with two gis platforms or move entirely to an open access gis? i hit a roadblock with transforming data from the existing gis platform  geomedia by intergraph hexagon  to open source  my geomedia locational data are utm coordinates in contrast to shapefiles or even latitude longitude i selected cartodb because i could use my existing excel data spreadsheets simply changing utm to latitude longitude data i also like some of the features of cartodb for displaying and manipulating map data and for the ability to directly code i am hoping i can attach my own base maps zoom in closer than i’ve been able  for intra-site analysis  and that it will hold a lot of spatial data last month i used an online conversion program in a small test case  underwater site 35  in which i converted utm coordinates to latitude longitude i entered the new data in an excel spreadsheet with other information about the site it worked however with thousands of mapped posts and artifacts i needed to find a better conversion plan for the long term i tried several programs and eventually found an online conversion program  http   earthpointus   that allows me to upload data in a spreadsheet  bulk convert  the program is free to students and teachers on request the program works and is accurate  ie plots posts in the same place as my proprietary gis  longer-term i may pursue using a program on github as suggested i realized how useful openrefine is for manipulating and cleaning big data files and how thankful i am that we were introduced to the software last summer at the institute for digital archaeology splitting columns changing capitalization and other modest transformations are easy for small data sets but the idea of modifying thousands of records is less overwhelming using openrefine my data are stored at utm coordinates as northing and easting in zone 16 north  i recorded the data for geomedia  gis in an excel spreadsheet as follows   i needed to transform the data in order to do bulk conversions to latitude and longitude for cartodb as follows   i selected site 74 for my pilot project because the site includes the variety of different kinds of information i want to be able to display and manipulate for project  wooden posts of different types  and species  and diameters; excavation transects individually-mapped artifacts excavated material recorded by 1 x 1 m units in 20 cm depths from the sea-floor to 60 cm depth; digital still and video images including underwater images; 3d artifact scans; and a 3d gis reconstruction movie the images below show off-site screening of excavated material arriving at site 74 on research flotation devices  rfds  and potsherds found on systematic survey    i created a new map in cartodb and attached my excel spreadsheet with some data here is a map of site 74 wooden posts  as point data  using the wizard to display different types of wooden building posts showing the footprints of 2 rectangular buildings site 74 is underwater with the posts barely protruding above the seafloor  next i want to map the transect excavations and units  polygons  and then display the densities of various kinds of artifacts by excavation unit here is a screenshot from my geomedia gis that shows the transects and units as polygons that are clickable the wooden posts are shown as green dots  point data  i do not know how to add the polygons in cartodb i also need to zoom in closer on cartodb as i can in the geomedia map below  the excavation transects were placed through the buildings to look at the material remains of activities especially salt production but also to see whether there is evidence of domestic activities as well artifact data are in excel spreadsheets that can be linked in cartodb  once i get the units added!  so far i have simply been using the options in the menus in cartodb but l have been looking at the html css and javascript coding so realize there are many opportunities for developing cartodb for my needs related activities in the last month include checking out other open-source gis programs 3d viewers and digital storage of data to access on the gis and web page the project fits into my academic job teaching 3d digital imaging and working with a team of undergraduate student workers and graduate students  all are diva lab scientists  in the diva lab  digital imaging and visualization in archaeology  on 3d scanning and 3d printing organizing 3d data and cleaning the underwater maya project data the 3d digital scans of artifacts are stored in several formats so they are usable for different printers and programs we also store the raw data so that the files can examined and stored in different formats when my diva lab scientists and i first started 3d printing artifacts in 2010 we only saved 3d scans as stl type files a common 3d file type that also works with our 3d printer when we got the photo- realistic 3d color printer last year we discovered it needs other file formats most of the 3d files are large and need to be reduced in size for uploading to various programs i will be looking into good file sizes for this project so that the site 74 3d scans can be reduced in size still saving the originals  organizing cleaning backing-up and archiving digital data are time-consuming but worthwhile when you want to use the information,
hi! my name is michele koons as curator of archaeology at the denver museum of nature and science  dmns  my job is to conduct field research communicate archaeology effectively to a wide audience and curate the archaeology collection  it was a true honor to have the opportunity to attend the digital archaeology institute at michigan state university this year i added so many exciting tools to my archaeology toolkit! because i am involved in so many diverse projects it was difficult to pick just one to focus on for the institute nonetheless i decided to focus on building a digital platform for a community-based archaeology program that we are just getting off the ground the denver museum of nature and science is heavily engaged in citizen science yet archaeology for the most part has taken a backseat the goal of a community-based project is to make archaeology accessible and knowable to a larger audience this includes k-12 students university students native communities volunteers archaeologists the interested general public donors and various other stakeholders the intention is to build a long-term and flexible program the well-known archaeological site magic mountain near golden co is the perfect location for our inaugural project  we are in the process of securing necessary permits permissions and partners to begin a project there nestled in the foothills along lena gulch magic mountain got its name from a now defunct amusement park located nearby prehistorically it was occupied between 5000 bc and 1000 ad and is proclaimed to be one of the most important sites on colorado’s front range however no popular literature exists on the site and it is not a large part of local lore or the identity of the region magic mountain was excavated twice in the past; first by harvard university in the 1950s and second by the crm firm centennial archaeology in the 1990s dmns houses the collections from the latter excavation  a preliminary visit to the site in july 2015 with the director of the 1990s project indicated there is still a lot work to do and a lot of interest in the community once permission is secured we propose to begin the archaeological program with drone photogrammetry to create 3d topographic maps and geophysical surveys to understand the subsurface environment later we will build an excavation program based on the results of this work i propose a two part digital project for the institute first i will build a website to act as a living platform that will develop alongside the archaeological project the website will have information on the site itself the logistics for the project information on how to get involved on various levels and tutorials on what is archaeology? and best practices this website will focus on blogging and providing live updates on the progress of the project the archaeological data will also be shared through the website a strong social media campaign will help promote the project within the community and with media outlets when the project is complete the website will serve as a project record part two will focus on crowdsourcing to compile information from existing site forms and artifacts from magic mountain in the upcoming year i will work with volunteers to scan the 1990s site forms and photograph the artifacts at dmns the digital transcription forms will be designed so that the information from the old forms can be integrated with newly collected data this will aid in open data sharing publishing in the future the crowdsourcing part of the project may not be completed this year but i will get the pieces in place for the development we are very excited to launch this community archaeology program for denver and beyond i am so grateful to continue working with and learning from the amazing community i met at the digital archaeology institute to bring this archaeological project into the digital age @michelekoons,
i’m trying a new project title on for size although the northern indigenous copper database was fine and descriptive it seemed lacking somewhat therefore i’m going to try out copper mines  copper metallurgy in indigenous northern society  i kind of like it for a few reasons 1  one of the main geological copper sources in the arctic are the coppermine mountains; 2  the acronym actually has a connection back to metallurgy; and 3  it is scalable for the addition of the inclusion of iron artifacts in the future  ie – iron mines or just mines  i have recently had some discussions with other folks working with northern metallurgy and have received positive feedback on the notion of an accessible database of the technology so incorporating room for growth from the beginning seems prudent  as for the project itself after quitting nunaliit i felt like i had been making significant progress in learning github workflows and developing my own project based on bootleaf and the ieldran database however i have quickly realized there are some significant pitfalls in beginning with a fully functioning project like these as a template for me at least i do not have a good enough grasp on coding specifics to be able to manipulate an existing project like ieldran and make it my own and if i did i would probably start from scratch anyway i have therefore started from scratch using bootstrap and leaflet to build up my own project rather than try and identify the specific way something was done in ieldran and change it to suit my needs i have begun the process of finding my own leaflet plugins and code examples to build the functionality of my project from the ground up two resources have been particularly helpful the last few days so i thought i would share them here w3schools  http   wwww3schoolscom   and leaflet tips and tricks  https   leanpubcom leaflet-tips-and-tricks  by malcolm maclean have both been very clear and provide easy to follow examples of building some of this functionality  my current state of progress is a main webpage with a basic structure built with the bootstrap grid system and a leaflet map with mapquest satellite tiles prominently displayed other than that however there is little content or interactive structure before moving forward i need to develop an overarching website structure that will guide the creation of the website rather than letting it grow organically i am planning on using trello or xmind for website conceptual design in order to have a better idea of an end goal before moving forward  i have also run into a similar problem that i hit after the initial institute meeting – an overabundance of options resulting in stagnation in choices specifically i have been trying for a while to decide what the best software is to organize my database the requirements i have include 1  integration with other software and the website i am building 2  relatively low learning curve and easy to operate understand 3  something that other people will be able to access and work with and 4  ideally a relational database personally the pattern i am seeing in software options is that software is either easily understood widely used but not easily integrated into a website or geospatial database  ie – microsoft access and filemaker pro  or software that is open flexible and able to be integrated into programs like qgis and leaflet but that require a learning curve of digital knowledge that requires time to learn and makes them more difficult to share with a wider audience  ie – mysql etc  perhaps that is just my rudimentary knowledge of these open source options shining through but i imagine i’m not the only one to hit a wall when investing in learning this software which makes them less appealing this is why i’m still currently working in excel once i commit to an sql database will the only people who will ever access it be digital people? excel is the devil i know  and the devil most other people know as well  does that make my data more ‘open’ than an open source program?  one final section to this wandering blog post the saa’s this year provided me with some much needed motivation the digital curation session on saturday afternoon was like a little mini-institute all over again with some very cool and exciting projects being presented i particularly liked the skope project  synthesizing knowledge of past environments   http   wwwenvireconorg skope-contact-information  and the chaco research archive  http   wwwchacoarchiveorg cra   check them out if you haven’t seen them before i also got a chance to talk to eric kansa about the status of my project one piece of advice in particular stuck out that i thought would be helpful to many of us about taking baby steps into having open and linked data he suggested simply including relevant hyperlinks in my database that will point to other important resources on the web in my case i am going to start incorporating links to the canadian archaeological radiocarbon database  http   wwwcanadianarchaeologyca   on each of my site files which will provide some valuable context about the sites and the context of radiocarbon dates obtained from them,
having largely decided on what tools to use  see previous posts  here here and here  ironing out how this process will actually work has been a bit more difficult than hoped two quick reminders first the goal of this project is to design  stitch together may a better term  tools for data collection and management  and eventually for archiving etc  that have relatively low adoption curves for most non-techie users the primary audiences is for those on the fringes  though the fringes may be larger and perhaps more important than the core  of archaeology- those who have limited resources such as graduate students contingent faculty faculty in small under-resourced schools independent scholars small contract firms etc second largely because of the first all tools should be open access and the aim should be open access data  yes perhaps with some- ie location- modified  kobo toolbox and postgis form the essential core tools in this process kobo toolbox is an easy to set up online offline browser-based data collection tool there really are no other open access tools comparable to kobo toolbox  though there are numerous commercial tools  postgis is one  of many  spatial databases i have chosen this largely because it is well-supported and widely used but other database types would be useful as well ok down to the nitty-gritty how to actually make this work! first we need to get data collected using kobo toolbox into the postgis database  because that is where the relational magic happens  this can be done through all three possible tools- qgis libreoffice base or pgadminiii determining which tool method was the quickest easiest and most accurate way took many many hours of tinkering i haven't talked much about pgadminiii which is the gui created to work with postgresql databases and therefore will work best with postgresql  postgis data  though that doesn't mean it is the best choice  qgis and libreoffice are designed to operate with a larger number of database types the key to understanding which tool is the most appropriate is remembering that your data is spatial if you bring data into pgadminiii or libreoffice base they do not recognize what type of data is in each field  aka column  you have to specify the type for each column in a large data table this can be quite laborious especially when using the postgis extension however qgis is designed to work with spatial data i found that importing recently-collected kobo toolbox data is best done through qgis here’s how it’s done  once you have your postgis database up and running  i needed a friend to help do this but once it is up and running you are good to go  start a new project in qgis within qgis click on the add delimited text layer button    the following shows the resultant display completed   most importantly note that qgis identifies the x and y fields as the fields automatically labeled by kobo toolbox as _location_longitute and _location_latitude if qgis does not identify these columns as the geometry fields you can do so with the drop down menu click ok in the next box you will need to identify a crs  coordinate reference system  kobo data is in wgs 84  epsg 4326  which is the most common crs  if you need to you can transform your data to a new crs later  although it is not perfect i encourage the use of wgs 84 because it can be deployed through the web more easily  eg via google maps cartobd etc  perhaps most importantly qgis also recognizes the format of many of the other columns this is incredibly important because certain functions can be done with certain types of data  eg only numbers stored as numbers can be used in calculations; only data stored as text can be used in categorical labeling within a map; etc  to see the format that qgis identified for each column right click the new layer and select layers then the fields tab you should see this   note many different types of data- qstring int double if i bring this database into postgis via libreoffice base or pgadminiii i will need to specify the types of course there are always problems with allowing software to automatically do nearly anything in the above students student16 is identified as qstring but in reality this is a boolean field  true or false  in this case it was collected as a radio button in kobo toolbox and identifies whether or not this particular student was involved in the collection of each data point this can be corrected later but we do not want to do that yet the data is now in qgis but still lives in the csv file qgis simply knows where to look to get data so that it can be mapped and the types of data so that they can be used appropriately  eg digits formatted as text cannot be used in a calculation  we want this data in our postgis database so that it can be related to other data first more the csv data to postgis this is relatively simple with db manager in qgis first be sure to establish a connection with your database  see this link  now that you have a connection you can interact with your database db manager is a tool to interact with spatial databases db manager is a plugin that is now part of the core download if it is not apparent you can always install it as a plug-in click on database-&gt; db manager -&gt; db manager at the top of the screen  you will see   expand postgis by clicking on the + you should see your database  if not you will need to establish a connection  your view should now look something like this   with the layer from your imported csv highlighted in the layers panel in qgis click on import layer  file    use settings similar to these   please note that you must identify the primary key as _uuid because this is a unique id assigned by kobo toolbox every table in a relational database must have a primary key that it uses to uniquely identify each record  row  you should not identify a column for geometry because there isn’t actually a column in the csv file for this qgis will create it based upon the two columns you told it to use as xy coordinates and store it in a geom column once you click ok you should see a message that your data was successfully imported although you have imported the data into your postgis database it will not yet appear in your qgis map to do so click on add postgis layers    in the subsequent screen establish a connection  if not already established through the browser you may need to click on new  then select the newly imported file your screen should look similar to this   once you have selected the appropriate file click on add this will add a new layer from your postgis database it should look similar to this   note that in the image above the newly imported postgis data  in red sits directly above the data in the csv file  in green  finally one should note that the main difference between the csv file and the table in the postgis database is that the data is defined by type however  there are two additional components of a relational database that make this conversion important first is the ability to establish relationships between tables  which you cannot do with csv files  second is the ability to update your data with new information  although there is no space  or time  for addressing both of these issues at this point these are important to remember in the strategy in subsequent posts i will address how to update your data with newly collected information and how to establish relationships it should be noted that this can be done through the same three tools- libreoffice base qgis and pgadminiii,
my name is alexandra parsons and i am an archeologist for the national park service  i specialize in the study of animal remains from archeological sites in the southeastern united states  for my institute project i plan to create a virtual museum showcasing artifacts found at an archeological site in florida  the archeological site was discovered during a dredging operation in the 1960s  dredging uncovered an unusually large group of well-preserved bone tools some of which still contain wood and pitch materials for hafting the objects onto a shaft  more than a thousand years ago native americans made these bone tools from different species of animals including raccoon deer turtle shark and sawfish in addition to traditional zooarchaeological analyses the artifacts are also being studied with new technologies such as 3d scans computed tomography  ct  scans and reflectance transformation imaging  rti   these technologies help to reveal the manufacture marks and traces from wear and damage on the surface of the bone tools  the research for this project is being led by the nagpra and applied science division of the southeast archeological center national park service  collaboration is already underway with the florida state university department of anthropology and the university of south florida alliance for integrated spatial technologies  the results of this important research will be shared with the public on the virtual museum the virtual museum will provide high-quality images and detailed information  visitors will be able to navigate through imagery and educational materials to learn more about the archeological site the artifact assemblage the cultural history of the area and the ecological setting  the primary goal of this project is to make the artifact collection digitally accessible to park visitors and members of the public who are unable to visit the archeological site  the website will be geared toward the general public  adults and youth  and will provide basic information for the archeological community  the virtual museum website will be hosted by the national park service and will be promoted through social media links from other websites discussions at professional conferences and outreach events emails to interested parties and a press release when the site goes live,
there are two major next steps in the development of our msudai project the online map of bioarchaeology  tomb   1  create the framework for the project and 2  develop the content over on the msu cultural heritage informatics initiative blog lisa shares our plans and the progress made on the development of the map website structure and geojson while she has been busy working on that aspect i’ve been developing the content since our project is going to feature a wide range of bioarchaeological examples we wanted the content to reflect the diverse types of burials and methods that are out there as well as be something that was useable to the public and academia the content can be divided into two categories first there is the map-based content this includes the name of the site or project the time period under investigation the location of the burials the number of individuals and graves at the site categories that this site is related to and a brief description this data is primarily so that the user can get a quick peek at the material from the site and determine whether or not this fits their interests for example one of the sites that we will include is the burials from jamestown the map based content for this site will likely look something like this     site  jamestown illicit buria,
it was only until last week that i could really focus on getting this project started really from the beginning this meant getting my geospatial data into a workable format to import into mapbox to create the basemaps for the project that in and of itself it not that complex but the issue is that the xy coordinates in my spreadsheet were actually points making up different polygons  thus i had to find a way to convert each set of points into a shapefile for each polygon and then combined the shapefiles into json script that could be read into mapbox  thankfully with much input from other participants and my trusty mentors i was able to do it using qgis  i can provide more detailed instructions if anyone is interested  so what basemap to use?  one important aspect of understanding petra is its topographic geomorphological context thus i really wanted a basemap that reflected that  of course the satellite image style in mapbox would probably work the best since it does nicely reflect petra's location  so i tried it first with only uploading the tomb polygons   however there are problems  first can you see the tombs?  can you?  look i helped out by putting a circle around them why don't i just use an image at a higher zoom level you ask?  because this is the highest zoom level there is in the satellite style  so i decided to use this image which will put the north ridge into the context of the rest of the site as the homepage map  as people click on the map to explore the north ridge features i will have to switch to another mapbox style did you notice the second problem?  the labels on this map are rife with errors - and there is no such thing as a red chaple  i had explored mapbox hoping that there was an easy way to correct the labels in the style  which would be useful for other users  but it looks as if i will just delete this layer and create my own with correct labels i am now in the process of figuring out leaflet to enhance the mapbox map which requires me going back to codeacademy and reviewing the javascript tutorial at this point i am going to focus on the mortuary aspect of the project and once i get all of that working i will add in the domestic structures city wall etc  the decisions that must be made - and figuring out at what point they should be made - is the most difficult part of this project i'm having fun with it which is what counts! incidentally i'm also going to be using omeka for a class project  my anth 3030 death and disease in the classical world   we'll see how that works! megan perry | east carolina universit,
diving deeper in the underwater maya project although i have a web site and have a draft web page created using html css and bootstrap on notepad++ i wonder periodically how i will be able to launch the web page on my web site i am continuing to tweak the web page on notepad++ and will continue to learn and improve my programming abilities to enhance the page i have been posting images here and there on the web so that i can reference them on my prototype web page lsu promises to have a digital repository in the fall which i hope will be useful for expansion of my prototype web page although i have been using adobe360  and other platforms  to share my 3d scans of artifacts i plan to post them on sketchfab for my msu digital archaeology project i have an account on sketchfab and see that the british museum has found it useful so it should work for me i will be in belize for lab research and will not have reliable internet until late june when i go to the government-sponsored belize archaeology symposium in the next few weeks while i am off the grid at my jungle field camp in belize doing artifact analysis 3d scanning and portable xrf assaying of artifacts with a couple of my hardy graduate students i also plan to work off-line on digitizing in qgis i have downloaded some tutorials so hope to make progress it’s not essential that i have excavation data for the msu digital prototype since i have lots of survey data but this provides me a nice opportunity since i do want to move from geomedia to qgis i continue to be very happy that qgis likes utm data since i have a ton of utm data from 10 years of underwater archaeology at the paynes creek salt works although i figured out how to bulk convert utm to longitude-latitude data i like being able to just use my excel files that i link to geomedia now i can link them to qgis i have been spending a lot of time organizing finding and cleaning digital data i have grad students who also have been working on data organization i will be presenting the results of my 2015 field research diving deeper  excavating underwater shell middens at deep water salt works at the belize archaeology symposium in late june  and have my powerpoint done!  so will send my next update then  or possibly sooner if i am able to get on the internet from the jungle ,
the reality of moving a portion of the spatial data collected over 10 years of fieldwork on the underwater maya project from intergraph’s geomedia gis to an open source gis has taken thought internet research experimentation and consultation with others  will geomedia remain the gis platform for storage and analysis of the spatial data with an open source platform used for display sharing and online manipulation of selected spatial data? alternatively is there an open source gis platform that can house the entire underwater maya spatial data while allowing me to provide selective public access? where will the spatial data be digitally stored so that it can be accessed by an open source gis? before beginning the next phase of the underwater maya field research i decided these issues needed to be addressed for the underwater maya project field data were mapped with a total station recording xyz coordinates of building posts artifacts shorelines and other things of interest the xyz coordinates were downloaded to excel and placed in the real world with utm easting and northing coordinates the excel spreadsheets were attached to the gis with the ability to update inside the gis or from the excel spreadsheet  and also to link different spreadsheets such as more detailed descriptions of artifacts  this system worked well in the remote field setting where we were mapping underwater sites with the prism pole in the water and downloading data to laptops powered by a generator at our jungle field camp at night with no internet access mapbox qgis and cartodb are options i have explored for the digital project rather than export geomedia utm coordinate data as shape files  which i learned is possible  i prefer to change the utm data to longitude latitudes the latter solution allows me to move more seamlessly from geomedia to cartodb for example and to move between the two gis programs i used paynes creek salt work 35 as a test case because it has a small data set but a nice rectangular wooden structure outlined by wooden posts as well as briquetage—the broken pots used to evaporate brine over fires to make salt searching online i found programs to translate utm coordinates to longitude latitude  i later got some good advice from my institute mentors about how to program this so that will be an upcoming adventure  i was able to add columns to my existing excel spreadsheet and point cartodb to the appropriate columns to my surprise the point data representing wooden posts of a rectangular salt production building appeared in the right place here’s the link to  the map in cartodb  https   underwatermayacartodbcom viz 0f68e3de-5c19-11e5-bbbc-0e8dde98a187 public_map  if you looked at the map you will have noticed the points are in the water but don’t worry the sites are all underwater submerged by sea-level rise and protected by mangrove peat that has dramatically preserved wooden buildings and other plants as well as protected the sites from wear and tear so the potsherds are large we do see jaguar paw prints on the seafloor at some shallow underwater sites but there has been relatively little post-depositional site trampling! my next step in this digital project is to select an underwater site to showcase the underwater maya project i will have to zoom in closer to allow viewers to see the data i hope i can do this in cartodb the selected site will have point and polygon data the latter being excavation units and transects from the sea floor down by levels i like some of the features in cartodb such as choropleth maps  good for showing overall abundance by units  and time-sequencing  i am going to try this on showing densities of artifacts in different depths of a transect excavation  first i need to change the utm data to long-lat which is a major undertaking i haven’t dealt with the polygon data yet   i also will bring in others to the project including current and former lsu students as well as other experts i have a grad assistant who can help on the project since the spring semester is about to begin and i will be teaching and otherwise consumed by academic life i have been trying out different 3d programs and web pages for linking 3d artifact and building post images to the gis  i have tried sketchfab adobe 360 and have looked at 3xdom an stl viewer for wordpress and various web pages that integrate 3d images i posted an image on the diva lab facebook page as a trial you can access and manipulate the 3d image of a partial vessel from the stingray lagoon site one of the paynes creek salt works belize  http   a360co 1pfd9ap the 3d image is a whole new world compared to the 2d drawing  which is a stunning drawing by artist mary lee eggart  in my book salt  white gold of the ancient maya  2002  figure 331  university press of florida in the next few weeks i will select a project underwater site begin translating the utm coordinate point data to longitude and latitudes and continue to explore what gis platform to use  whether or not cartodb is the best choice for me  i will continue to explore possibilities for digital repository of data to be accessed on the gis i am excited to see a digital humanities initiative at lsu which may include digital archiving reading the posts from fellow institute of digital archaeology method and practice colleagues and mentors is exciting to see progress of others and to gain insight into how others have solved digital archaeology problems that i also encounter,
this is my long-overdue update on mina i stopped juggling balls and made time to work on mina and i'm happy that you can see some of it here  dnguptagithubio minagithubio i won't call this version 10 there are still quite a few issues to address before a formal launch for one if you are on some versions of chrome you will see a wonky basemap like this   =attachment_3135 style=width  810px  aligncenter>mapboxgl on chrome v 510270484n  so far the base map has displayed correctly on firefox and internet explorer it loads up on mobile devices but i'm not sure about the touch capabilities  =attachment_3138 style=width  810px  aligncenter>mapboxgl on firefox  and this is where error checking comes in i spend a lot of time inspecting the web page when it loads when the page loads very slow i am sure there are errors in the code it sure helps to have a big screen  =attachment_3136 style=width  810px  aligncenter>error tracking on a big screen  issues bootstrap + mapbxox + leaflet = it could be awesome  i've seen examples!;when the platforms are well developed  as maria pointed out in her recent post mapbox has moved away from studio classic this was the platform we used last summer and it had good integration with the leaflet library the new platform mapbox studio is different we now publish  styles' and reference them when coding gone are the map ids familiar to classic users more importantly mapbox has introduced webgl application program interfaces  apis  that are intended to integrate seamlessly with studio all of this means that code that was beautifully written  tried tested true  for mapbox + leaflet + bootstrap does not work the same way this does not mean that the three can't work together for mina i have been using bootstrap for the overall web template  ie the html for navigation bar footer  mapbox is serving the tiles and map style  ie base map country boundaries place names  and leaflet is for user interaction  ie the little +   - on top left display markers and simple popup on click  with the map to do this i've used a script that is under development here  mapboxgl-leaflet &#8212; you know you are in development mode when the only link you find is to github! the markers are parsed through leaflet-omnivore from a csv that i uploaded to mina's github the map is centred and the pan and zoom features work with a lag try it you will see the base map plays catch up with the marker layer this is a known issue#41 and issue#30 a few solutions posted that i have not yet tried there's the issue of attribution only leaflet shows up on the bottom right i've tried adding the standard attribution we used with ltilelayer i think there must be a way of course there are a number of things that i want to add to the map including user interaction and changing the look and feel but it is satisfying to have a workable web map up and  ahem  walking? ,
hello again everyone! as i planned i've been collecting more information about the history of the pocumtuck fort archaeology and stewardship project  fpasp  and related archaeology and history work my goal for the month was to identify short bits of compelling relatable content to use on the website and i have!  i am not ready to share yet - some of these came from an interview with one of the researchers so i will be asking for permission to use them  when you last heard from me i was also looking into visual narrative construction i thought instead of citing more articles i read on the topic i would follow the suggestion of msudai faculty member dr shawn graham to do some text analysis visualization for this month's post* i decided to go back to a tool i learned while working and tweeting through shawn graham's digital history course  voyant-toolsorg i input four publications from the fpasp in chronological order into their web interface and came up with this    voyant tools lets you explore basic trends in the text including the ubiquitous word cloud i explored for a while and used my observations to reflect on my sources and design plan   =attachment_3047 style=width  610px  alignnone>wordcloud of the pocumtuck fort archaeology and stewardship project publications  recent reflections on the project including a publication by drs hart and chilton have focused on the challenges of poly-communal archaeology this wordcloud reveals more of the original intent of the project fthe prominence of native is consistent with what i've learned studying the history of the pfasp; the project's recent leaders dr chilton and dr hart were inspired primarily by the realms of decolonizing and indigenous archaeologies when their interactions with local stakeholders prompted them to start this phase of work i have been fiddling with the terms and here are a couple views i found interesting   =attachment_3050 style=width  1034px  alignnone>frequency and repetition of the most-used terms throughout the text notably more recent publications  near the right side of the screen  don't use archaeological much perhaps reflecting the current state of the project as a stewardship effort native has persisted throughout the history of the project    =attachment_3049 style=width  610px  alignnone>the frequency of the word communities peaks during theory-focused sections of the publications but is not used much during the methods-focused portions     =attachment_3051 style=width  610px  alignnone>the frequency of the word testing peaks in the phd dissertation around where poly-communal research procedures were described but were barely used otherwise  what have i learned from this techy fiddling? i should include some metadata when i link to research products such as publications in the portfolio section of the site; the distribution of themes like indigeneity history prehistory divide and traditional archaeological terms like testing is a clever way of providing more information about the development of ideas throughout the ten year project the theoretical methodological and practical aspects of the project have developed in ways that are not necessarily discussed in publications but which can be revealed somewhat by these text-based trends last but not least what are my goals for this month? get the portfolio portion of the website running  the easy part  and input at least 20 historical tidbits into the website database so i can begin getting them to interact how i've envisioned using php  *i tried experimenting with a markov chain generator on matt furden's github to answer how likely i was to finish this project as i envision it given my writing in this blog and in my own notes however i wasn't able to figure it out in the time i alotted to work on this blog post,
shawn graham has said multiple times that his approach to digital projects can be characterized as failing in public this is me failing this project has its roots in my dissertation in which i standardized information from multiple sites in order to analyze ceramic variation across sites standardization and validation of data in a database? check for msudai one of the things that i needed to do was to develop a website that will explain the project and give individuals access to the data ethan and others challenged me to not simply rely upon something like wordpress to create a website so i went down the path of self-hosting and building a website using the bootstrap framework i made a site it’s reasonably pretty and i’m getting some background information up there about valdivia generally and about this project specifically website interface? check so where does the fail come in? the part in between the structure and language or program that i need to connect the two pieces people have suggested kora opencontext and geojson but i’m not sure how to implement any of those  despite reading documentation  or how to integrate them into the bootstrap framework or where it’s hosted on github    so this is me failing in public for a few months in a row hopefully next month will have something more positive to report,
good to read what everyone else has been up to and the various issues people are recognizing dealing with and developing solutions for my project is going slowly &#8212; but doing fine we have spent much time over the past few month digitizing fieldnotes and associated records for this legacy project; i'm happy to say this phase of the project is almost finished to date we have approximately 4000 pages of mostly handwritten fieldnotes artifact counts and weights by unit site as you can imagine we rescanned some several times for view-ability so the unit summaries and level descriptions could be used in their original handwritten format for this project like others in our digital archaeology group about 2 3 of the way through i realized names were on several of these summaries and there was discussion on how to proceed since none of these records are final reports &#8212; we will blocking out name identification for the internal files  our records  we are keeping the names but for the external face of the project we are using the unit identification only using the unit level designations should also work nicely with our plans for an interactive site map for the project mechanics we maintain the relational database for our internal use and can cross reference year unit summary and people associated with the project etc maps are next on the list to digitize and then create the inter active site map as many of you many remember fort ancient is not my research focus and is another learning process for me &#8212; this was another reason to begin with scanning i have a much better handle on what we have what we don't and what directions the interactive components of the project can handle it is becoming clear that a content specialist will be needed to review edit text and i'm hoping that one or two of our alumni who are now practicing archaeologists in the region will consider assisting the project happily i am also now working with 2 students and a colleague on the project and a third student will hopefully join us soon discussions have started and will continue for  the next several weeks on our web presence and the website hopefully in the next month or so i will be able to provide a link to our homepage we know the importance of visually stunning  and relevant  images to attract people's attention and we continue to work on what topics are necessary thank goodness the image digitization was completed last fall and perhaps in my next post i will add an image or two jud,
the semester is flying by yet progress since my last post has been a bit slow &#8212; i was out sick for a few weeks but things are improving and progress is occurring two students and i are working on various aspects of the introductory text content of fort ancient culture for our website it's been a challenge to provide enough detail and information while keeping the text understandable to a broad audience including middle high school students as well as the general public once i'm satisfied with the content &#8212; an alumni who specializes in this period has agreed to review it and offer suggestions edits for april we will continue to focus on content but also our use of interactive maps &#8212; i'm looking forward to that aspect of the project,
the bulk of my project work over the last several months has focused on preparing artifact data for the historic fort snelling building  the short barracks  that i plan to publish in opencontext project staff and volunteers have steadily been creating inventory records while combing through the boxes and boxes of collections in order to provide a consistent and well-structured  of course!  index linking the objects to important things like which of the 600+ boxes they are stored in we use controlled vocabulary terms to characterize the collections i continue to be pleased with how well the getty’s art and architecture thesaurus covers the types of artifacts we need to describe but we have added local vocabulary terms as needed for things like ox shoes to distinguish them from horse shoes for example i am also trying to capture the original catalog descriptions inside these basic inventory records many of the project volunteers have been steadily transcribing the old paper forms so that they can be added to the records created through inventory in fact i have already married transcriptions with the inventory data for three small buildings at the site working with the original 1970s catalogs for the short barracks has turned out to be much harder than any of the other building catalogs though i quickly realized the a team had not been assigned to this cataloging let’s just say someone had a lot of trouble numbering artifacts correctly among other things for the 6650 descriptions matched i annotated 490 records to explain the problems such as the artifact labeled 317551 does not match the catalog description for that number it matches the description for 317561 annotation has been on my mind since the beginning so it’s interesting that the dataset i chose needed so much of it right out of the gate any good researcher will want to add data right? misidentifications along with errors like the ones i found are practically guaranteed my partner dr kathryn hayes will undoubtedly need to add descriptive information as well github seems like the perfect tool for version control of datasets but i would like to explore various ways to approach this issue after some trial and error i have managed to generate an acceptable xml export report to extract the short barracks data from mnhs collections management database technically it is ready for eric kansa to review i have experimented a bit with open refine to look at the data in csv form and found some elements are still not structured as i would like i need to learn more about open refine conversion mapping in fact i need to learn a lot more about using open refine in general ensuring that i push all aspects of my project forward is challenging  because working with data is my first love  i gave a presentation at the midwest historic archaeology conference in minneapolis this fall to raise awareness of my work i also met with my university of minnesota partner kathryn hayes and mnhs fort snelling program specialist matt cassady i plan a second round of meetings in the next month to discuss the direction of the public facing interpretive components,
south american archaeologists much like archaeologists all over the world are experts at exploring ancient interaction  who was moving where what they took with them and who they spent time with a topic that created a lot of research and buzz over the last 10 years for example was possible genetic exchange between anatomically modern humans and neanderthal populations in europe in northern chile southern bolivia and northwestern argentina  communities were in contact for thousands of years as mobile foragers or through trade caravans that traded ideas and objects such connections exist today the modern movement of people and objects however is influenced by today's national borders these borders have been heavily militarized too so borders are not simply lines drawn in the mountains archaeological understanding of past interaction is also affected by national borders each scholar's work depends on their access to different types of employment money to travel to conferences the availability of academic publications and the possibility of research funds these resources are not distributed similarly across all nations any collaboration among researchers from even neighboring countries is deeply influenced by such differences the study of pottery which we know was traded throughout the south-central andes is complicated by several issues  not all scholars can travel to international conferences with the same ease  no matter where they are  publications are either difficult to get or they are too expensive to produce and send abroad in large numbers not all scholars are able to spend the same amount of time on data collection analysis or writing up their results  often scholars work on ceramics that are well-published in neighboring countries without access to that literature in an effort to forge more collaboration among international scholars of south-central andean ceramics my colleagues and i have initiated a series of workshops and symposia centered around the idea that we need to interact as much as ancient communities did to better understand the past particularly why and how past people shared pottery in their houses and graves it began with a symposium at the chilean archaeological congress in 2012 called interactuemos nosotros tambien  let's interact as well  followed by a wenner gren workshop in 2013 called sigamos interactuando  let's continue interacting  these activities brought scholars from five countries together to synthesize each region's ceramic knowledge in a form easily understood by their neighbors we wanted to overcome our tendency to assume our neighbors define and use the same ceramic types we do we are now developing our next step which will use new digital publishing tools presented in the institute for digital archaeology methods and practice at michigan state university - east lansing shaping this next stage of our project is ongoing we are contemplating together how to recognize our collaborative work in new ways and leverage digital platforms to emphasize our fundamentally visual data keep posted to hear how we figure it out we will be looking at other examples developing new skills in social media to encourage participation from others and thinking together about how our work can be enhanced and socialized through best practices in digital archaeology emily stovel  swca environmental consultants albuquerque nm usa  instituto de investigación arqueológica y museo gustavo le paige san pedro de atacama chil,
the first web embedded 3d panoramic image of eagles nest using a panoscan camera taken on 1 16 16 at the usc wrigley marine science center visible in image from r to l-lynn dodd wendy teeter lindsay jacoby sanford george marilyn lundberg image copyright lynn dodd copyright of eagles nest image is marilyn lundberg  it’s been a number of months since a rag tag group of archaeologists were brought to michigan state to become tech savvy i came away feeling excited but i had taken in so much that i felt overwhelmed like everything was leaking out of me i remember very little of the technical details of what i learned during that wonderful week-long session because my work and family life curbed my enthusiasm for quick progress now i’m not sure how my vision  see the first blog  can be implemented or where to begin but i do have friends and colleagues that i can talk to and hopefully i can figure out enough foundation to receive guidance from our project mentors usc professor lynn dodd and i had discussed this digital project and she provided some creative collaboration solutions that dovetailed with on-going usc research projects she was working on a project that would bring archaeology photo-realistic artifacts and immersive environments together in a game platform yeah! this could help me acquire the data that i need for the eagles nest lodge  enl  website this project is focused on the experience history and historical archaeology of catalina island through the lens of enl a historical structure still standing  barely  in middle canyon mlk weekend 2016 brought folks together on catalina to develop content train faculty and students create assets for the website and also accomplish ongoing pimu catalina island archaeology project  pciap  work being led by other pciap co-directors desiree martinez and karimah kennedy richardson my weekend goal was to learn more about usc's project the technology used and how that could feed into this humble project i say humble here only because my project is web-resident based on html pages while theirs is able to be displayed in immersive 3d 360° spaces for oculus gear vr or even imax  the benefits of the enl web-based collaborative project is that it will be available to anyone with a web browser making accessible the rich history of catalina island in a way never before done and it will be a substantial open source educational resource professor marilyn lundberg csula grad student lindsay jacoby and usc undergraduates sandy george and chris bhutani along with lynn and myself formed the technical crew the catalina island conservancy and usc wrigley marine science center provided logistical support to get the gear and our crew inside enl  thank you!   a very wet friday was spent taking 360° spherical panoramic images using both a panoscan camera and a digital slr camera rig these provide a visitor with a 360° immersive experience of the interior exteriors and approach to eagles nest so that the visitor can approach the building on the road once used for stagecoaches come to the front door and then step inside to explore at their own pace and to the desired depth the panoscan camera is the only camera that creates a stitchless panorama it required a couple of us to haul its cases but once installed it took high resolution evenly-lit images in mere minutes without additional human intervention simultaneously sandy took 360° panoramic images using gear that he brought tucked into his pack along with his lunch his technique used overlapping images of all parts of the room and he too created impressive well-lit high resolution 360°  panoramic images in very little time the ease of mobility of his equipment meant that he was able to move quickly from one location to another to make 360°  panoramic images solo without help from anyone else by saturday all the imagery had been processed and within a few hours we could again feel like we were standing inside the enl using an oculus vr headset the panoramas from both techniques were amazing for their quality and the feeling of seamless movement however as we discussed their use in my project it became clear that what i hoped to do with the panoscans  which was to use the spherical panoramas to fill in missing pieces in a 3d reconstruction based on historical photos  would not be possible without the investment of a fair amount of time and money chris and lynn are working on using 3d objects immersed in a 3d environment separately i want to allow visitors to walk into an immersive historical environment where they can select objects and learn about them and historical catalina life panoscans can’t be colorized easily nor can we quickly add hotspots within the oculus without using some kind of additional program such as the game engine unity or unreal fortunately the 360° spherical panoramas we made can be embedded in a website also we have a site plan with building elevations that will allow us to use a program like google sketch-up to overlay historical images on created walls with hotspot hyperlinks to 3d images of objects that can be manipulated by the visitor we also discussed the layouts of the different rooms and assets that would be used within each i still have lots of ideas for this project bouncing around but within more of a plan lindsay and i will develop a website storyboard to keep the project on track in addition i need to finish a database of artifacts and images bring that database into kora create an immersive background of enl at various points in history using a mashup of sketchup panoramas and historical photos select artifacts and create 3d images of them with a nextengine 3d scanner create hyperlinks inside the created backgrounds and so much more while i feel that i’m at a tech-knowledge base disadvantage i feel this weekend has launched a good working collaborative team and has begun to translate the vision into a website reality with more opportunity for steady progress,
this week’s task was very high-level planning mostly inside my own head but also beginning to involve others from my agency since my institute project will in reality be a bite-sized version of a much bigger agency data management project deliberate and careful planning is a very high priority i had a great time presenting a very brief overview of all we learned msu last month to the full range of staff at our agency-wide meeting although archaeologists don’t make up the majority of positions here at dhr all of the topics were relevant well beyond us below-ground types i could hear folks buzzing about other potential projects; it was exciting i also took the opportunity to introduce my project concept to the larger audience while i await feedback from institute faculty i’m feeling my way around creating a structure for this project next week i’ll be having a more focused meeting with archives division staff our it manager and some other archaeologists at this point i’m hoping to present my vision and make sure i’ve got buy-in from as many people as possible so far everyone i’ve informally spoken with seems to be on board although i definitely want feedback if anyone sees any red flags that i’m missing now is the time to make them known it’s definitely hard to temper my enthusiasm we’ve got such a rich dataset here and it’s going to be orders of magnitude more valuable once it’s accessible,
i had no idea when i outlined my project last summer that my university of minnesota partner professor kathryn hayes would create so many great resources i could use for it over the winter kathryn hayes’ students have completed the digitization of all of the historic and excavation maps for fort snelling  they were also able to geo-reference  almost  all of them their work will enable me to get good location data for most of the provenience units in the short barracks collections data set i also had no plans last summer to connect the fort snelling collections data with anything like virtual reality but the university of minnesota tech team shared the 360 degree imaging they did on the short barracks building their 360 files will potentially allow me to use a great resource that already exists – the reconstructed historic fort snelling buildings in exploring the possibilities offered by the 360 images i found a virtual tour online for the american museum of natural history that uses embedded links to more information i think this kind of virtual tour could work really well for the collections data i want to highlight i set up a meeting in june with the umn staff to discuss ways we could collaborate on an amnh-like demo of the short barracks  matt cassady the interpretive specialist for fort snelling is particularly interested in the possibility of a 360 virtual tour one of his goals is to provide access to the site online for anyone who can’t tour the site in person and to give school groups who go on real world tours ways to explore the site further i would like to see insights from the archaeological research woven into the interpretation at the site rather than the way it is now where it is treated as a separate aspect  i am still focusing my interpretative efforts on the musical instrument keys recovered from the bottom of the short barracks excavations matt told me about a reference that says army musicians were housed in the basement of the short barracks in the late 1820s the archaeology data confirms this chronology and can even show exactly what part of the basement they were in i think this data could segue to more information about the role of music in the military – do the keys come from band instruments a fife or a keyed bugle? bugles were used primarily for communication not entertainment this could also link to a new volunteer fife and drum corps initiative at the fort for students who would like to learn more about military music i need to have open reusable data to realize the interpretive parts of my project and i reached a key project milestone in the last month – draft publication of my data in open context preparing my data for publication gave me a chance to realize a long term goal eric kansa walked me through queries to the getty’s art and architecture thesaurus  aat  sparql endpoint to retrieve resource identifiers  uris  for the aat terms in my data set now i don’t just have descriptive data that is semantically clear i have data that can play a part in linked open data discovery and research,
what can be accomplished in the jungle with 2 students 15 buckets of maya artifacts a 3d scanner portable xrf machine and a generator? staying with our host family who provide room and board and lab and office space for us to work means we can accomplish a lot i had more incentive since i first had to travel to the belize government institute of archaeology in belmopan—the capital city—to obtain and pay a fee for a lab permit belmopan is not on the way to our field camp 15 miles by boat only up the coast from the nearest town punta gorda in the toledo district of southern belize my digital archaeology project is a pilot study for the larger underwater maya project therefore we are collecting data for my pilot study as well as for the larger project we brought buckets of artifacts stores in town in a house that fell down  leaving the once-indoor storage open to the weather sharpie labels washed off buckets filled with water and seeped into zip-lock bags with artifacts artifacts had orange yellow and brown slime mold and other organic growth which also was on the bags the first task was to wash the artifacts and bags bake the artifacts in the sun to dry them and place them in relabeled bags my grad student kurt has started 3d scanning selected artifacts with 20 days of research at 6-8 artifact scans per day that’s 120 to 160 scans so have to be selective in what is 3d imaged we are doing 2d photos of all artifacts first with a labeled bag so we can identify each artifact and then with a scale on black velvet how do i select what artifacts to 3d image? briquetage—the pots used to evaporate brine over fires to make salt—includes jars vertical wall basins bowls pot legs sockets spacers and bases socket are formed clay with a concave surface where the vessel rested on top of the pot leg bases are formed clay where the socket rested on the ground or salt evaporation table spacers are disks with 2 concave surfaces that fit the body of adjacent pots to hold them apart over the fire during evaporation i selected large reconstructable rim sherds and good examples of sockets and spacers i also am selecting water jars with distinctive stamped decoration—that are temporally diagnostic and may also inform on origin of manufacture—serving bowls figurines and anything unusual i put chert jadeite and other stone apart for later i am also selecting salt-making pots with holes that may have been used to drain the salt-enriched brine into pots the 3d scanning works well with the generator needing refueling about 3 30pm each day kurt scans all day and during supper the portable xrf machine which provides compositional information of artifacts is the first time in the jungle i have successfully visually identified obsidian to its volcanic highland origin but the portable xrf machine is more scientific since obsidian does not naturally occur in the limestone platform of the yucatan peninsula identifying its highland source helps reconstruct trade routes and the economy my grad student kelsey is assaying obsidian and overlaying data from known outcrops so far she has found a lot of ixtepeque and some el chayal in guatemala as well as some material from a less common outcrop in central mexico yesterday the portable xrf machine stopped working likely due to high humidity which was about 90% i was able to call our contact who asked if we could put the machine in an air-conditioned room overnight readers realize this is not possible in our jungle we did put the pxrf in its pelican case with several cases of desiccant which we re-activated by heating in the wood stove for several hours i am organizing artifacts washing artifacts and relabeling bags updating data records and trying to ensure that we had 3d scans photos attribute analyses for sherds and drawings some of the data are from site 74 my digital archaeology project staying remotely in the jungle at our host family’s organic farm allows me to be focused on the task at hand there are few normal distractions the nearest people are 15 miles away by boat there are no roads there are no walls we live in peaceful coexistence with nature including all kinds of biting insects such as sandflies mosquitoes and doctor flies fortunately i no longer react to their bites my students are not so lucky yet jungle creatures can and do wander through our living area i smooth out the dirt on the ground under the thatch in the guesthouse where i sleep so i can identify the size of animals that pass through at night i cannot see them through the heavy cotton tent on the wooden platform in the middle of the room small footprints are likely from agoutis i have a phone that i use to call out if i get enough bars our host family has a satellite dish for internet but it is so unreliable and slow that i rarely try it or give up after several hours of trying to send a message the internet is working now! my phone works and provides a link to the outside world and safety net good bye for now from the jungle,

it's january 2016  already ! the project is moving along - mostly on my objective  1  to develop a database of archaeological investigations this is a multifaceted task because place names and other information have to be extracted from pdf files ie primarily unstructured text before it can be geocoded with latitude and longitude coordinates figure 1 is an example of unstructured text   over the last few weeks i extracted relevant information from indian archaeology in review covering the years 1953 to 1960 there are now 2366 records in the comma separated value  csv  file and include geographical information such as  i  place name  usually a village name sometimes archaeological site name ;  ii  the district  an administrative-territorial division ; and  iii  state  a larger administrative-territorial division  i've included the year of investigation the type of investigation  exploration or excavation  and where available the broad culture-historical period as reported since i am most interested in who was doing all this work for each investigation i extracted  i  the institution and any collaborators;  ii  the archaeological team or department; and  iii  names of individual archaeologist s  i am currently cleaning these data in open refine the main issues i have run into have to do with 1  my own data entry errors; and 2  pre-existing issues in individual reports particularly with locational information the latter is problematic for geocoding for example a place name might have multiple spellings or the district may no longer exist place names districts and states change! there were 676 districts 29 states and 7 union territories in india in 2014 they are reorganized completely or partially absorbed into others and renamed a geocoding service in 2016 doesn't necessarily have previous and alternate names i am not sure there is a short cut for this it has meant some painful hours to clean and adopt current names for example in the 1950s bombay was a state  and a city and district  it was reorganized to create the state of maharashtra there are many many more examples here i address only a change in the name even though these changes are social political economic and territorial in nature  beyond the scope of the objective  with a  clean' file i can geocode records and get them up on a map i manually searched for coordinates for about 10% of the records and with this subset i will test a couple of geocoders such as qgis mmqgis  opens new tab  geopy and mapmyindia there are others i'll write more on geocoders in my next post,
as promised in my previous post  this post is about using kobo toolbox  as a data collection tool for archaeology i also address important issues that have materialized as i design and use forms in kobo toolbox what is kobo toolbox? kobo toolbox is an open source suite of tools for the collection and analysis of humanitarian data- especially in remote places or after a disaster kobo toolbox is comprised of three different tools one for form design one for data collection and another for data analysis  the latter is rather simple and won't be discussed here  kobo toolbox can be used from their website or installed on a local server it was designed by a fairly large collective organized by the harvard humanitarian initiative and supported by lots of heavy hitters including the united nations the international rescue committee and us government- through usaid it is very well supported and has a very active and dynamic user and collaborator communityit appears to be sustainable similarly the data collection form is based upon enketo another open source well supported and actively growing tool why kobo toolbox? first and most importantly kobo toolbox is device independent  though there is an android app as well  instead of operating via an app it runs as a webform that can be accessed through a browser on any device that can run a browser  browser does need to be updated to handle html5; google chrome seems to be the best at this point; see this  with the expansion of the use of smartphones throughout the world this is incredibly significant anyone with a device with a browser can collect data personally in trying to devise ways to collect archaeological data digitally i purchased software and hardware into the $1000s- and i was doing it on the cheap as my two ipads aged substantially between field seasons i became increasingly frustrated because the expectation was that i was going to need to purchase new ipads in the near future- i was stuck in the technology treadmill the system was unsustainable with kobo toolbox an inexpensive smart phone  yes they do exist  is all one needs data collection becomes much less restricted and the opportunities for collaboration with interested communities especially in remote places is much much greater second web forms can be used off-line! that’s right a web form that can be used off-line this is essential for nearly all situations in archaeology even if you have access to the internet  through nearby wifi or a cellular data connection  it is likely that your connection will be cut at some point- usually the most inconvenient one- leaving you unable to collect data not with kobo toolbox you can continue to collect data; it will upload and synchronize once a data connection has been reestablished how much data is based upon the browser and settings with the browser; here's details for google chrome important update  questions are stored in question banks that can now be shared! third kobo toolbox includes an intuitive form design tool via the web most importantly this means that the learning curve or threshold is very low i was able to create basic forms in minutes the very first time i tried the tool however for more advanced data collection the web design tool can be nearly as complicated as one desires data types are varied and include everything from alphanumeric to gps location to images and audio there are some qualifiers here; for example barcodes can be collected using the android app but not the web form data can be collected by radio buttons check boxes drop down lists and many other ways options include skip logic  ie show certain questions based upon the response to previous questions  and validation criteria both of which increase ease of use and the reliability of the data form construction can be even more complex if xlsforms  http   xlsformorg    based upon the open standard xforms; https   wwww3org markup forms    are used xlsforms can be designed using the ubiquitous microsoft excel  libreoffice calc  https   wwwlibreofficeorg discover calc    could be used as well and the file saved as xls  the tool therefore is incredibly easy to use from the very beginning but can be as complex as the user demands  =attachment_2835 style=width  680px  aligncenter>a portion of the data collection form in kobo toolbox  how about a quick example? in the fall of 2015 i taught a course entitled historical ecology of the lehigh gap at muhlenberg college which was clustered with another course degradation and restoration taught by my colleague kimberly heiman as a component of this course we mapped plant distributions along a transect through the lehigh gap nature center the lehigh gap is a superfund site contaminated by heavy metals from a zinc factory the purpose of the transect was to identify different plants that represented degraded or restored communities i created the form  see example  in an evening and shared the link with the students  in the field students pulled up the link on their smartphones although there were some hiccups the form worked like a charm we had one phone that could not use the forms- we still do not know why some students found that one browser was preferable to others  chrome seemed to be the best  and we had significant issues collecting photos except for a few exceptions gps coordinates were within their known error  c 10 meters  those points that were not located within the expected 10 meters appear to have been random that is there was no apparent pattern that would suggest particular phone brands individual phones or users that were less accurate than others the data was exported  via csv  and imported into cartodb which students used to analyze the spatial distribution of plants the map below shows one day of collection and only shows one plant sweet birch which in this case actually shows the effectiveness of prescribed burns on the northeastern portion of the transect  birch tend to pull heavy metals from the soil and reintroduce them into the ecosystem; controlled burns limit the growth of birch   =attachment_2834 style=width  1929px  aligncenter>a sample of data collected in kobo toolbox being displayed in cartodb  this was a particularly effective exercise we were able to collect approximately 75 data points on 10 plants at 10 meters intervals  ie a distance of 3 4 kilometers  in approximately 2 hours with 17 students data collection required no special tools but students were able to collect and analyze a rich data set with relatively simple intuitive tools ok it may appear that i am trying to sell kobo toolbox however let's face it there are some drawbacks to kobo toolbox  first data entry via a small screen virtually requires that typing be minimized- drop down boxes radio buttons etc are far superior this means that it is preferable to design these types of data entry into the form which has the positive effect of standardized data but also can reduce recording important narrative data really this is not a drawback of kobo toolbox but of the device narrative data would be best collected via audio or text through voice recognition but neither of these is ideal either second because kobo toolbox is designed around location collected through the device gps it is wonderful for survey but the location aspect is less useful for excavation if a sub-centimeter rtk gps was connected to the device  via bluetooth?  the location aspect of the form would be much more useful for archaeology but that requires serious expense  or perhaps not  the device could also be connected via bluetooth to a total station etc for increased locational control excavation data is likely better collected via a tablet rather than a phone third initially i wanted a tool that could be connected directly to a relational database; at this point this cannot be easily done with kobo toolbox however because the format of the kobo export is a csv file the data can be easily synchronized with any database relational or otherwise with relatively little effort i am now convinced that this sort of compartmentalization is actually preferable with such a format the user can decide how to store analyze and archive their data while i now prefer a postgis database accessed through a libreoffice base others may prefer to database types or guis compartmentalization means that no one tool is reliant upon any other but it does mean that standardized  and preferably open  data formats are required to go between tools compartmentalization also means that forms must be designed with the database in mind and vice versa the database must be designed with the intension that all data will be arriving in csv files  alternatives include kml and xls; except images audio etc which must be entered into the database manually  fourth i also initially wanted the ability to modify forms in the field i was able to do this with my initial filemaker pro database but only because i carried the server into the field however i used adjusted forms largely during field testing adjusting forms in kobo toolbox once they have been deployed is difficult requires an internet connection and new projects must be created with new urls etc  side note- you can install kobo toolbox on your own server and take it into the field  however once past the testing phase this may not be important; once data collection has begun in earnest changing forms is usually a poor idea because it reduces consistency and makes synchronization more difficult although kobo toolbox has some important limitations i now consider these limitations to be beneficial open source tools that do one thing extremely well and that use open standards and open file formats are preferable because their output is useful in a wide variety of other tools  and in ways that i cannot even imagine ,
i’ve got the basics of my kora repository set and i’ve begun ingesting objects while i did start with a nice organized list of fields from our databases i ended up combining our specialized fields with those i found in existing kora schema so there is some fat to trim but i’m getting there,
well its official folks - the application deadline for the neh funded institute for digital archaeology method and practice has passed  quite honestly we're blown away by the amount of interest the institute has received  we received 187 applications from every corner of the archaeological  and associated disciplinary  world  crm companies state and federal institutions museums heritage institutions and organizations universities archives libraries and independent scholars - all were represented from among the applicants  we were particularly impressed that from the academic world applications ranged from the most junior of graduate students to department chairs  and even a dean  now the hard part  the really hard part  - choosing 20 people to accept;a spectacularly difficult undertaking given the clear quality of all who took the time to apply  so sit tight - we'll make the selection over the next month and send out acceptance emails by march 15th in the meantime if you have any questions about the institute don't hesitate to let us know,
my name is wendy giddens teeter curator of archaeology at the fowler museum at ucla as an archaeologist i am a co-director of the pimu catalina island archaeology project  pciap  this blog is to document the creation of a website to present our work at eagles nest hunting lodge on catalina island aside from excavation at this historic location our mission is to understand and protect the more than 8000 years of cultural history on the island while working with the gabrielino tongva community and local islanders with more than 100 years of previous archaeological research we hope to build off these undertakings and support new research projects using new methods knowledge and technology please see pimuweeblycom for further information  =attachment_2437 style=width  506px  aligncenter>eagles nest in the 1920s   project description  eagles nest hunting lodge was built in 1896 by joseph and hancock banning as a hunting camp and stagecoach stop it has gone through many transformations as ownership of the island changed to william wrigley in 1919 and then to the catalina island conservancy in 1972 archaeological excavations by pciap occurred from 2008-2014 to assist with mitigation of the california environmental quality act and to further contextualize the history of the location in preparation of the lodge becoming an historical museum a virtual presence pciap has unpublished data archival photos stories and historical items and will create a virtual exhibition and provide public access to the raw data while also providing a summary of our findings and how it enhances understanding of three major components in the life of this building  banning wrigley conservancy  i will be blogging about the creation of this website with the struggles and surprises that i expect it to bring more specifically this digital project will create a virtual museum exhibition that allows the visitor to select a time period  1890s 1930s 1970s  and then explore the hunting lodge and what life was like within that temporal framework in addition there will be an archaeological component that shows our site map  showing our excavation units  that can be clicked each unit will have highlighted images along with the official inventories so that people could play with the data and make their own interpretations this could feed into a k-12 component there are three thousand people that live on catalina island and more than a million visitors yearly many of these islanders and visitors are multi-generational and have specific memories of eagles nest either as a holiday location hunting area or as a tourist stop where they received lemonade coffee and cookies inland island tours still stop here generating a great deal of interest into its history although there is currently no information that focuses on the history of the eagles nest hunting lodge and how it exemplifies the vision each land owner had for the island partners the pimu catalina island archaeology project  pciap  has never worked on its own it is with  generous support and assistance of many people that the project continues to be so successful  excavations at eagles nest have been through field courses sponsored by ucla cotsen institute of archaeology ucla law school’s tribal learning community and educational exchange institute for field research and csun anthropology our permit is from the catalina island conservancy ongoing support is being given by the catalina island museum fowler museum at ucla usc archaeology usc spatial sciences usc environmental studies and wrigley marine institute and the city of avalon,
hi we’re katy meyers emery and lisa bright we’re both currently anthropology phd students at michigan state university studying mortuary archaeology over the next year we will be working together to produce ossuarykb  the mortuary method and practice knowledge base mortuary archaeology is the study of the material remains of funerary behavior and the deceased in the past and deals with a wide range of evidence across time and space we want to leverage this diversity to improve standards increase conversation and collaboration between different periods and regions of research and improve methods and practice in order to do this we need a single knowledge base where mortuary archaeologists can see best practices exemplar case studies innovative methods and more this knowledge base will allow researchers to find new methods see innovative practices connect with other archaeologists comment on these new methods and share their own work  each project included in the site will have identifiers or keywords that relate to the methods and practices that they are using that will allow people to easily find the project based on those words for example santa clara valley medical center historic-era cemetery would be listed as a project with keywords such as ‘historic’ ‘inhumation’ ‘block-lifting’ ‘low preservation’ ‘redwood coffins’ etc users who were interested in learning about unique methods for dealing with ‘low preservation’ would look that up in the knowledge base and learn about projects like this each record about the site will include a narrative about the site citations any documentation they used and space for commenting from the archaeologists and users in addition to the project records there will be information about the new and traditional methods that these projects are using we will also provide links to various websites or databases that are linked to the projects methods or practices- such as links to asu standards or babao forms  we look forward to working together as well as with the other msudai participants and mentors over the next year please feel free to reach out with any comments or questions  katy - @bonesdonotlie lisa - @lisa_n_bright,
hello everyone my name is kate ellenberger i am a phd candidate at binghamton university  suny  i am currently working on my dissertation project about the development of critical collaborative archaeologies i am passionate about teaching archaeology and that is where my institute capstone project originated over the next year i will be working on teachingarchaeologyorg a website where people who teach about archaeology can access and collaborate on lessons my experience in developing lessons for public archaeology teaching has made me concerned about 3 things     lessons are scattered; there is no definitive resource that is also updated frequentlypressforward i also need to learn more about using the pinterest web development platform so i can also pull in resources shared by teachers and archaeologists on pinterest as for commenting i am going to experiment with neat tools that let people comment on websites word-for-word post text images or even upload documents as responses  like commentpress and hypothesisis  as you can tell i have a lot of new things to explore and figure out how they work so i can put them all together! i am excited to continue working with the digital archaeology institute community and beyond this year to make this project happen  kate ellenberger  @precatlady,
it's been quite a while since my last post but i have definitely not been idle in my initial timeline i had hoped to have some concrete progress at this point but there have definitely been advantages to taking things slowly i've continued soaking up skills and information i've gotten some great feedback from my mentors i've also spoke with digital librarians in virginia i presented a paper at the society for historical archaeology conference on making virginia's data more open  and this repository will be a huge part of that  i'm taking an online digital curation course through university college london as well as following along with shawn graham's crafting digital history course this semester to build even more skills so yeah busy as the timeline is compressed i'm always conscious of adjusting scope and scale i'm still focusing the repository on gray literature at the core but i also want to connect other types of project documents related to the archaeological investigations covered in the crm reports so for now i'm thinking i'm going to start with ten reports representing ten different archaeological excavations that way i can include site photos maps artifact photos and other types of assets to relate to the excavations and really demonstrate the true power of a linked repository over the next couple of weeks i plan to focus my efforts on selecting content and beginning to develop my schema in kora stay tuned,
taking a free online course through adobe education exchange has been really helpful in getting this project off of the ground i’ve found that being enrolled in a class or at the very least working in a team on a project helps motivate me to get work done as a faculty member and administrator i am enrolled in a course called web design which teaches students the basics of web design through the use of adobe muse so far i am really impressed with the ease of the interface and the ability to design a site without a knowledge of the code i recognize it isn’t open access or free but i do appreciate the free educational content available to educators and adobe users like myself through adobe educational exchange in the past i have pieced together my knowledge of software using websites and youtube which isn’t exactly the best way to learn software over the past few weeks i’ve learned more about design and the workflow involved in web design probably the most important lesson i’ve taken away from the course is less is more note that i don’t have a good deal of control over the design of my laboratory’s website as our university has established fonts and color schemes that i need to follow this saves a lot of time on my end because i can often get bogged down by the minutiae of design elements i’ve learned about mood boards which help you envision what a particular color scheme and font scheme looks like i also learned about wireframes which is essentially a way of creating a simple layout of a website before coding and or designing it i learned about style tiles  http   styletiles   which helps you develop mood boards and build upon your wireframe templates for free i discovered the noun project  https   thenounprojectcom   which provides free icons and graphics licensed under creative commons just as a refresher i am developing a digital archaeological museum and web presence for my lab  an archaeological repository in the state of idaho  i originally planned to code the website on my own and while i did play with coding some of it i abandoned that process in favor of trying adobe muse muse does not require a knowledge of code which made me a bit skeptical of its power i was worried that it would not be able to accommodate my project’s needs such as creating a slideshow of our collection photos or allowing me to create a responsive website moving forward with muse also meant that i was throwing in the towel with coding the website by myself which was a bit hard to give up however i realized that my time constraints were limiting my ability to get this website up and running and the goal of this project is to get something digital online and accessible to the public it also meant stepping back from my original design of the website which was to create an image map of the ten northern idaho counties that our archaeological repository serves my idea was that visitors would click on a particular county and then be directed to a website featuring that particular county’s collections i realized that creating a responsive image map was a bit of a hurdle and moved forward with something that was working  muse  with my schedule and met the project’s timeline  august!  since my last blog i have worked on a wireframe for my website  and used this free wireframe editor to make one  https   wireframecc   added a navigation menu using the widgit feature in adobe muse created a slideshow of artifacts from one of lab’s collections using the widgit feature in adobe muse and developed more content in terms of housekeeping items to get the website online and accessible i worked with my university’s information technology department to get a url and server space for our website our new website will be located at webpagesuidahoedu bowerslab in the coming month i will work on captioning photos in our collection slideshows and developing additional content for our collection webpages this additional content includes taking professional photographs of artifacts scanning archival data associated with the collections and identifying relevant public outreach materials to showcase on our website if i have time in the next month i also want to start experimenting with qr codes on the physical collection boxes in our laboratory and linking them to our website this will allow our lab visitors to scan the codes with their mobile phones and quickly find content  such as artifact photographs  without opening the physical curatorial boxes housing the artifacts  =attachment_2819 style=width  160px  alignleft>wireframe layout of the collection pages for the bowers laboratory  =attachment_2825 style=width  160px  alignleft>layout of the bowers laboratory's website in adobe muse  =attachment_2821 style=width  160px  alignleft>bowers laboratory's resource page for educators and parents  =attachment_2820 style=width  160px  alignleft>the layout of one of the bowers laboratory's collection pages  the mckee collection,
though i haven’t done as much as i wanted to do with my project during the fall semester i have been playing with new technologies and approaches to data thanks to the institute on digital archaeology i took a course on advanced design in the virtual environment of unity developed a large database of digital technologies and scholarship for other scholars at my university to reference using trello  which i learned about at the neh institute!  and applied for and received a grant to create an online database of archaeological data from my current archaeological project  a wwii japanese american incarceration camp in idaho  i have also been working with a team of scholars at my university to create a digital humanities and social sciences center that would help facilitate the type of scholarship that i have been doing this past year and a half i have started using drupal with the help of the university of idaho’s northwest knowledge network and will be using it to manage data from archaeological sites associated with japanese american incarceration i am also in the process of developing a short seminar on digital archaeology for our graduate students and the readings for it can be found here  anth 521 so while the fall wasn’t exactly as productive as i wanted it to be in terms of this project i have harnessed much of the information i gleaned from the institute to initiate and develop new digital projects if there is something i have taken away from the institute thus far it is the notion that failure and play with new technologies is part of the learning process rather than backing away from new technologies i have become comfortable with the idea that i can play with them and i can figure out if they work for me if they take too much time i have been okay with moving on and trying a new piece of software or content management system i have had to re-learn how i learn which has been helpful as a teacher and professor i’ve learned some of the pitfalls my students might experience if i ask that they try some new technologies and i’ve learned that it is okay to move on to something different if this particular content management system or software program isn’t working for me or the data i am examining the hard thing about failure and simply playing or toying with new technologies is that it is often not something that ends up on your resume or cv; it isn’t a metric that can be assessed or quantified for a pre-tenure or post-tenure review as someone who hopes to achieve a promotion to full professor someday i am very conscious of how i spend my time each and every day hopefully this institute as well as other new and exciting digital humanities and social sciences initiatives and institutes will pave the way for new forms of scholarship and experimentation that don’t simply involve a line on a cv continuing with the theme of ambiguity and failure i have been working on developing my lab’s website over the past month i direct one of three state archaeological repositories in idaho and my goal with this institute project is to develop a webpage for our lab that provides information about our work including on our collections and holdings i first tried forking code from someone’s design housed on github but i struggled to figure out how to save my edits and get them approved for publication i looked at themes on bootstrap but through that process i couldn’t find something that fit what i wanted for my lab’s website i began to play with coding a website in adobe dreamweaver and made my own personal webpage by using some of the code i already knew and some of the code i learned through the institute however i realized that if i want a truly responsive website in the time frame i have to complete it for our lab i really need a program that assists me with some of the coding i also have to take into account my university’s branding requirements which involves rules about color schemes font and typology and logo usage i started searching for programs that would support these parameters and restrictions and discovered adobe muse i also found that adobe offers free online courses so i signed up for a live online course through adobe education exchange i have been very impressed with the course so far and have been working on my lab’s website design using muse as part of the course i have also learned how i might better format my future online courses as adobe really motivates students to get things completed this is the website i have designed thus far using adobe muse     i am looking forward to seeing where this website takes our lab and the new funding and research opportunities that may arise for others or for our own lab because of it dr stacey l camp  associate professor of anthropology  director alfred w bowers laboratory of anthropology  scamp@uidahoed,
i'm nearly recovered from a fantastic society for american archaeology conference where i presented a three minute lightning talk on my repository project at the digital data interest group meeting this is the typed version of my talk in person it was a little more off-the-cuff with much animated gesticulation here's what i said ,
i think most archaeologists would agree that time gives us perspective each day of the intense week in august 2015 of training during the institute on digital archaeology method and practice at michigan state university was not just eye-opening it was deeply revelatory topics as seemingly mundane as digital publishing—which sounds like a how-to manual for properly formatting and uploading papers—in fact called into question the nature of the academy today and our goals as academics just what are we doing and why? the how-to portions of the workshop were equally astounding introducing us to a new world of open source data and tools that make the archaeological world and possibilities for understanding it so much grander than before given the overwhelming opportunities for better understanding and sharing knowledge it is daunting to decide on the  exactly what to do and smartest way to do it but reaching for something doable does not mean sacrificing what seemed a dream although i am the person participating in the msu digital archaeology workshop my efforts are co-planned and co-authored with the staff of the eastern band of cherokee indians tribal historic preservation office since 2008 we have implemented the historic cherokee landscapes project which investigates cherokee community resilience and reformation during the 16th through 18th century this was a period of volatile change in the us southeast due to warfare disease and involvement in global economic networks associated with european colonization while colonial expansion was profoundly violently transformative it also embarked within a much longer native american political social and economic history our goals are to understand the nature of these changes through excellent research and then restore this muted or silenced past to the public chefs des chiroquois à londres en 1762  cherokee chiefs in london in 1762  plate xi [11] in histoire d'angleterre ; tome troisième by françois anne david  1800  chez l'auteur f a david rue pierre-sarrazin paris courtesy of the john carter brown library at brown universityhistorical evidence shows that cherokees played critical political and economic roles during the upheaval of 1540-1730 while archaeological evidence is abundant and provides evidence of what tends to be left out of written accounts  the tenor of daily life colonial strategies not only tried to contain native americans through forced resettlement but also unsee their very presence by treating land as wilderness uninhabited or widowed this empty land was in fact where native americans lived harvested food and performed other acts of daily life 2015 field school student justice littlejohn maps features from test excavations at cowee near franklin north carolina  archaeological and archival work is just one step in recovering this past; equally important is organizing and integrating information about regional ecology town plans architecture and activities in different places in a thoughtful and workable manner the kora digital repository and publishing platform offers a double solution  secure and customized warehousing of all kinds of data as well as flexibility to make appropriate portions of that data available to researchers and the general public the hope is that the kind of work we already do—download photographs reports and spreadsheets etc—will have a home that gives it a coherence that multiple data silos  files stored on a hard drive  do not a well-conceived and implemented digital repository can be an archive in the best sense  secure durable adaptable and responsive  and not in the worst  the digital equivalent to a dusty box of file folders that may or may not be labeled correctly on the outside  that is a dream worth making real but for our goals a digital repository is not enough our challenge is to recover traces of past generations and better recognize the enduring testimony of people who left an indelible record of themselves their connections to each other and their role in pivotal historical events whose legacy persists today this means that to recognize the power of the past in the present requires sharing knowledge and there’s the real challenge—what is the most relevant way to share knowledge with the people you most want to reach? russ townsend ebci tribal historic preservation officer observed that what is comfortable and familiar to a large proportion of the cherokee public is a mobile phone application most people have cell phones are used to downloading apps and make use of their phones as much or more often than computers on a daily basis what a fantastic dream to have an app that would share with you cherokee town names and archaeological and historical discoveries as you took care of shopping taking the kids to basketball practice or filling the car with gas people would see georeferenced hot spots in and around cherokee in a new way by discovering its past  =attachment_2481 style=width  241px  alignleft>checking a cell phone while visiting an archaeological site  many exciting and informative digital resources about cherokee history are available on the web such as the cherokee nation online history teaching resources from the unc school of education and even mount vernon’s website an impressive digital resource is wild south’s interactive map of cherokee trails and the history and geography of the cherokee people of western north carolina done by lamar marshall with the support of a grant from google earth accessing these resources is best done with a computer however a mobile app would provide a dynamic complement to these other learning opportunities pinch me i think i’m dreaming,
with the august deadlines launch return to michigan pending and having gone down many digital rabbit holes most of which were not foreseen and only some of which were successful i find myself facing the realities of what i have how much time i have left and what i can still achieve and not be embarrassed of! this month was a bit of a back to basics month after my computer went on strike at the most inopportune moment about a month and a half ago i spent most of the time since my last blog reinstalling all the programs that i needed to get back on track  git adobe suite etc  at the same time i refreshed my memory about mapbox and cartodb  which we were introduced to last summer at the first installment of the dai  for some mapping of the field sites included in the database i eventually settled on mapbox for the relatively intuitive set up in the classical mode the interactive capabilities with pins labels and the easy functions for embedding and sharing  though i am still trying to sort out if it is possible to include a hyperlink in the pop-up label to transport user to further information – so if you have details please let me know!  screen captures of the mapbox project for the monumental archive project  click for interactive map   along with the database and the controlled variables the primary building blocks of the website are slowly coming together somewhat scaled back from original visions and slightly less high tech the website will still keep the primary goals of providing user-friendly open access data and a place to discuss contemporary approaches to cemetery research when it comes down to it the bells and whistles aren't nearly as important as the function of sharing data and the message that monument data should really be open access the next couple months will be focussed on building the final frameworks for the function of the website making the database live and accessible and setting the stage for what i’m sure will be a much longer process than originally hoped for so this is a classic tim gunn ‘make it work’ moment – nose to the grindstone and see what comes out in a few months,
since the last post i have spent a great deal of time researching hypertext stories a hypertext story is essentially a genre of electronic literature that allows the reader to interact with the narrative users read a story supplemented by photos and videos and they are provided options throughout the story via hyperlinks highlighted key words throughout the story allow the user to select various options or prompts to continue through the story or to receive supplemental information relating to the story itself  =attachment_2931 style=width  285px  aligncenter>snapshot of otp archaeology tour  in the case of otp a hypertext program has been used to construct a tour of the historic site the text including the first portion of the tour is complete and undergoing review this first portion of the tour offers the user an interactive experience while visiting an archaeological excavation on the otp property the second portion of the tour will be written in the following months the archaeology portion of the twine tour is nearly complete excluding a few artifact typology definitions i have begun tinkering with the css and html for the program and i have encountered a few minor hang ups my plan is to use a photograph of an excavation unit or section of a unit that can serve as the background to this portion of the tour i would like to use an icon in the sidebar to depict the name of the project and the estimated launch date i will update this icon after the launch date and it will include the site number property name and the date of the final launch for the tour i am going to design the icon like a mini sign board something that you may encounter in the field as an archaeologist  the sidebar will also include my name as the creator of the tour and include a list of the partners involved with this project the main wordpress website will eventually include a page that describes the contributions and duties of each partner  =attachment_2937 style=width  164px  alignleft>troubleshooting  image overlaps outside of the story passage frame  i have encountered a couple of minor hang ups with the css style sheet for this project this morning i believe i discovered a solution to the problem i am trying to insert graphics and text via css in the sidebar which i should really be doing this via the html  i assume  i think what i will do is upload the newest version of the tour to github then create a new branch from there and start tinkering with the cosmetic features i haven’t done this so far with this project because i wanted to focus on completing the text first so i wouldn’t get lost in the code i will re-visit this topic in my next entry and let you know if i was able to resolve the solution  =attachment_2935 style=width  129px  alignright>signboard icon included in twine tour  last time i spoke about trying 123d catch for this project well… that was a fail! i went to the site one day and collected gopro footage and used 123d catch to collect scans of the building my gopro footage came out well  however 123d catch sort of crashed while it was processing images i was using the gopro in the background and happened to lose the internet connection at the same time i lost all of the images and nothing processed i will try again in the coming weeks this time only allow the ipad to process one scan at a time i have reached out to the park service to inquire about making a final visit to the property specifically to get inside of the building to take photos i did this in the summer but once i started looking at my pictures i saw that most of them are not in-focus i will go out with a different camera and try again adding audio to the tour is going to be the greatest challenge i’m not sure where to go for that data i would like to keep some sort of audio playing in the background like several other hypertext stories i’ve seen i am still looking for a place to collect free audio and to post the audio online so that i can link it to my tour if anyone out there has any suggestions for this please let me know one final note i am still trying to draw in followers for this project via social media i plan to start adding photos to my posts by april pending partner approval i’m hoping that will increase traffic goals reached     nearly complete with my archaeology tour presently on track with my in-house march-april deadline for that portion of the tourunexpected it solutions    none to report  current it hangups    fix html so that sidebar displays correcting add cosmetic features to tourgoals still in the works     finish archaeology tour by march – april  still on track must increase social media follower traffic,
in shifting my project toward a specific research project the biggest challenge is now matching the function of the website with the intellectual goals of the pocumtuck fort heritage work it represents the most recent phase of research has been poly-communalengaging diverse local and non-local stakeholders in collective heritage work that aims to restructure traditional power relationships in archaeological projects  hart 2009 viii  in pursuing this goal researchers involved in the project have studied created and critically examined stories of the fabled native american fort that span time and perspective as i understand it the desired outcome has not been to tell one single  correct' narrative of what the pocumtuck fort means but to elucidate how the existing narratives were constructed for this capstone product i am creating dr hart and i set the goal of allowing visitors to construct a narrative from selected pieces of information from the umass amherst-based research projects surrounding pocumtuck deerfield heritage the website i am building needs to have both content and functionality which are consistent with the goals of the pocumtuck fort archaeology and stewardship project we came up with an initial idea a few months ago which has three sections  if you are thinking from a technological standpoint      a front page which introduces the visitor to the purpose and functioning of the website; graphic accessible modernipinpro first if i can get it to install on a subdomain even better my challenge with wordpress will be whether i can have three different themes  vastly different ways of rendering the data i feed into it  on one domain or if i will be forced to make it a clunky multi-site still i am convinced wordpress will be the easiest thing for my supervisor and her collaborators to maintain moderate and update in the future if this works i will then complete my planned php course so i can disable the visitor's ability to create new pins and that will take me a significant way toward the website functioning how we had planned next on the docket is php application pinderful to be honest i am not sure how to even use this thing but i guess i can install it on my domain and use it like pinterest? i assume that when i get to this point i will really need to expand my php knowledge so i can fiddle with its functionality and appearance for now i am hoping to borrow and modify someone else's code to my own purposes and crossing my fingers i don't need to start from scratch,
hello i want to introduce you to map indian archaeology a web-based map platform that can enable linking to dynamic and static sources of information on the practice of archaeology in india archaeology in independent india is socially and politically sensitive this situation impacts the collection and interpretation of archaeological data  in march 2003 the pages of times of india carried word that the archaeological survey of india—henceforth the survey the national department for archaeology and heritage management in india—had begun court-ordered field excavations at the grounds of the demolished babri masjid a medieval mosque in the northern city of ayodhya there on december 6 1992 kar sevaks  hindu volunteers  who believed that the remains of an ancient temple lay beneath the standing mosque tore it down unleashing a wave of riots that resulted in the loss of human life in ayodhya and elsewhere in india public interest in this social issue—reflected in intensified media scrutiny on indian archaeology—has drawn attention to particular archaeologists their aims methods and knowledge claims previous research while fruitful has focused on colonial archaeologists and those who worked in prominent positions within the national government overlooking an overall role of archaeology in indian society this situation is reflected in sensitive relations between local communities and national institutions particularly over ownership of cultural heritage i discuss these concerns in detail in my recent article entitled social and political factors in post-colonial indian archaeology  the case of sanghol punjab  read here  the web-based geographic platform aims to provide scholars local communities and national governments with a tool to understand nuances in indian archaeology the project has three main initiatives to encourage discussion and intellectual interest in indian archaeology they are ,
the past several weeks have been relatively productive both in terms of making progress on the digital component of the northern indigenous copper database and the more mundane organizational tasks associated with preparing a large dataset  working with my dissertation data on this project is proving to be a double edged sword  on the one hand preliminary organization and sorting of the data is a time consuming process that often comes into conflict with the other time consuming task of climbing the learning curve of web-design  though certainly necessary and extremely important for my doctoral research it necessarily often takes priority over working with my digital project particularly as conference season is bearing down upon us  on the other hand working with an evolving database is allowing my to organize my data in a way that will make it much easier to integrate into the final digital project which i believe i will ultimately be grateful for i continue to feel good about my decision to abandon the nunaliit framework as the basis for my project and switch to using a modified bootleaf to craft a geospatial database  i think many if not all of us owe a great deal of thanks to katy meyers and the obviously significant amount of work she put into creating the ieldran database  i know that i and several other of the institute participants have benefited greatly from having the ieldran project as a guiding framework in the creation of our own projects  in addition everyone's public trial and error in the digital commons has allowed me to circumvent many common problems and has been extremely helpful as for my own project i have established a github repo and published gh-page to take the work that katy has done with modifying bootleaf and make it work for the northern indigenous copper database   i won't link to it here as it is still essentially the ieldran database and i wouldn't want to take much credit for it at the moment   i have been successful in modifying what i like to call the  window dressing' components of the site such as colors and text and have been working with the leaflet component to focus in on my study area  moving forward i don't forsee much in the way of roadblocks with this type of modification of the site *knock on wood*  my current task is gaining a better understanding of the way external data is incorporated into bootleaf and how the csv files are converted to geojson files for display  since my database is currently exportable to csv once i figure this one out i should be much further along the path of making the site my own on a side note i want to recommend an open source mind-mapping software to anyone who may have been struggling with project organization  xmind has turned out to be extremely helpful in organizing not only my tasks for this project but balancing it with my dissertation and various other side projects i have going on  there is a free version that ended up being helpful enough that i shelled out money for the pay version  with a significant academic discount  that added gantt chart integration as well as a number of other features  check out the free version and see if it might help you,
as a participant in a recent hackathon i also became a participant in an academic study of the role and format of social networks in the creative process by a graduate student from rutgers university as we ‘hacked and yakked’ about web archives data mining and visualisation and historical research in the background our interactions methods and progression were being recorded and analysed as an anthropologist i’m far from inexperienced with the prospects and procedures for recording and studying people and their behaviours but it also made me hyperaware of what i was doing who i was talking to and what impact that was having  and how an outsider might see it all  since then i have been ruminating on the creative process in digital archaeology  =attachment_2862 style=width  570px  aligncenter>visualising the digital creativity process  mindmeister   we were warned in august that we would come away from michigan with a great deal of motivation excitement and creative ideas and that as we went through the process and problems arose or time constraints became more apparent all that energy would wane a bit that’s one of the reasons we’ve been assigned these blogs – to motivate us to incrementally get things done in a lot of ways this process and experience parallels the progression of most research projects it’s why we have deadlines  real or imagined  and it’s why we often miss deadlines or at least face deadline-induced panic near the end it’s usually viewed as part of the creative process what i have been wondering is  has the digital world altered the creative process for archaeologists  and more generally ? when it comes to digital archaeology what is the impact of technology on the way we do things? there have been a number of recent publications concerned with the adoption of and adaptation to technological innovations in archaeology being critiqued both as providing a social platform for new approaches to archaeology and an anti-social barrier to creative and responsible archaeological practice for the past two decades perry and beale  2015  have underlined that the social web… entangles archaeology in relations of production consumption and world-making that have deep repercussions not only for what we know about the past but for who we are as people in the present and in times ahead but that complex relationship is not one we have critically engaged with walker  2014  pushes this concern further arguing that despite a sense of techno-utopianism there are a range of barriers to equality authority and collaboration moreover when one looks at discussions of creativity and suggestions for improving creativity and innovation one often finds the overarching theme to be unplugging writing and drawing in a notebook sitting in a coffee shop going for a walk i will be forthright in confessing that my relationship with computers has been a bit dodgy and this surely has coloured my perception of the creative process involving my digital counterparts however i do apply digital data management visualisation and dissemination on a regular basis i also have a growing awareness of changes and incompatibilities in my practice as an archaeologist my notes for my msu dai project continue to be analog rather than digital and the digital applications that i have been researching and learning how to implement somehow seem less appealing now than they did in the summer  =attachment_2860 style=width  650px  aligncenter>analog notes for what to create digitally  this might be typical mid-research disillusionment but how do i know when i have achieved a virtual task and how do i judge its value? given the immediacy of web-based communications why is it that we often seem to communicate less with mentors or colleagues? and perhaps more importantly do i really understand my data better with a computer calculating and analysing it for me? in creating a digital repository for monumental archives is it really making it any more accessible or will individuals continue to repeat the recording of cemeteries over and over again until they no longer exist in the physical world? this is far from a coherent discussion about creativity in the digital world and these experiences are entirely my own rather than the result of systematic study but given the recent blog posts by my fellow dai-ers there seems to be some underlining uncomfortableness with the process so i would be interested in other perspectives perhaps my concerns are more symptomatic of the fact that i haven’t learned enough about these tools to fully understand them and use them effectively or perhaps the creative process that i have been relying on in past projects needs to adapt to new frameworks and platforms having said this i have spent the past four weeks building the web-platform for the monumental archive project using bootstrap and github as well as ruminating on how best to create and communicate controlled vocabularies for my next blog i hope to write more about creating and implementing controlled vocabularies for a less abstract  and slightly angsty  post dominic walker  2014  antisocial media in archaeology?

since january i have encountered a handful of minor it hang-ups regarding the use of github social media outlets and twuffer about a week ago i also experienced my first instance of feature creep after i discovered 123d catch i was unable to make any additional project to my twine tour since january's update this update will therefore address the problems that i have encountered within the last month and provide the solutions i discovered to these problems  with the support of msu's digiarch community  at the close of my last blog update i set up an account with twuffer  i pre-scheduled several tweets i had planned to publish in january the first tweet was a success and so i assumed all was well when i returned to otp's webspace  a few days later i noticed that none of my additional tweets had been published i began searching for a solution several members within the digiarch community suggested i check into using tweetdeck i created a new account at the start of february i'm very pleased with the switch tweetdeck is virtually idiot proof to set up and i like that i can see the stream of upcoming tweets that i've scheduled this way i can easily decide when i should start adding more otp now has a running feed under the handle @ordinary_tavern; hashtags #otp and #msudai will be used with each tweet so that the project will gain the most publicity as the creator of otp i wanted to save myself the time of manually sharing each tweet digi-arch entry and wordpress update by finding a way to connect each of these programs together  i decided to use twitterfeed which offers a quick and easy way to add updates to multiple social media outlets every time a blog receives an update i use twitterfeed to share blog entries and facebook posts via twitter for the archaeological society of new jersey  asnj  website and i find the set-up to be quick and reliable i hadn't used github since the close of our digiarch conference in august and i anticipated that i would need some time to get re-acquainted with the program by re-acquainted i mean that i essentially stared at my main log-in account for about a hour before remembering that i also needed to download github desktop to get things moving afterwards i encountered the following problems and solutions ,
update  data collection for the digital catalog of cappadocian ceiling crosses is complete i’m a blog post behind so this will be a two-parter here in part 1 i’ll be reflecting on why collecting data managed to drag on for months  and how i hope to prevent that in the future  touching on some issues that i suspect are fairly wide-spread among msudai participants then in part 2 i’ll reflect on what it means to complete a task but still not feel ‘good’ about the results  =attachment_3084 style=width  310px  alignright>these books were my last data collection hurdle to clear for the catalog of ceiling crosses  the last push for my data collection was to comb through a two-volume set of books and record ceiling crosses that were recently published by other scholars for the first time it started to feel like the data was haunting me  the paperbacks arrived from france a little banged up from the journey they’ve since been hauled into every room of my apartment; they fell victim to an incident wherein i knocked a glass of water onto my bookshelf of dissertation sources just before a phone meeting with my advisor; and both accompanied me on a trip to go apartment hunting in a new city  why on earth couldn’t i just deal with them already? the problem for me though was not necessarily time but headspace in online conversations with other participants about digital projects and other work life obligations over the last few months there was definitely a theme of being pulled in too many directions it feels like there’s never enough time and progress has a start-and-stop quality to it which can be deflating however setting aside time didn’t always help me catch up this time and that in itself was frustrating over the winter i had dedicated an hour or two each evening for digital projects including this one and tutorials from shawn’s awesome online digital history course but too often i had run out of steam by the time i could sit down at laptop the long cold winter was definitely a factor in terms of motivation and dissertation obligations couldn’t be ignored however i pledged a while back to stop beating myself up over incomplete to-do lists for work—especially the fun parts of work!—but to try to learn something from the situation so here’s what i came up with my goal became to figure out what kinds of energy or attention projects were using in addition to the time needed to complete them for example my experiments with and interpretations of data need creative energy the same as writing or reading complex theory so that means in order to concentrate i need to do them fairly early in the day  as in after a coffee or two but before the afternoon floppy feeling kicks in as my friend jamie used to call it  it also means i can’t really expect to write a large chunk of a dissertation chapter in the morning and then delve right in to a heavy-duty digital project in the afternoon i’ve started trying to pair heavy-thinking projects with smaller tasks  like cleaning up my zotero libraries  within a day tool tutorials it turns out are hard for me to follow by myself without jumping down time-consuming rabbit holes the buddy system is helpful as twitter and the dac proved repeatedly over the last few months on the wish list  i’d love some kind of regular working group for troubleshooting is there a tutorial equivalent to shut up and write? i’m still trying to figure out how teaching energy compares to article writing or researching so this system will have to evolve over time i suspect teaching will pair well with writing blog posts or tutorials these observations have helped me start to incorporate the time of day and type of work into my scheduling  a concept which would undoubtedly vary widely and wildly among researchers and be quite different for introverts versus extroverts  but lurking in the background has been the irksome feeling that the data doesn’t feel done ready in the next post i peel away a few of the layers on the phenomenon of data insecurity al mcmichael  @byzcap,
there’s underlying conflict running throughout my work much of my dissertation argues against the tidy model of categorizing images which was a concept that established the field of art history in the nineteenth century as one of categories and connoisseurship i’m arguing among other things that a group of images  monumental ceiling crosses  are a useful category to study as a group even though they don’t fit a neat typology so there’s underlying resistance as i now try to fit them all into clean data don’t get me wrong—i think being able to view humanities research as data is crucial—but to do that we’ve got to suss out where the tensions lie as noted in my previous post i’m finished collecting data and have moved on to cleaning it but i’m not really trusting my findings it’s easy to chalk that up to the impostor syndrome of a dissertation writer but i think there’s more to it and we can benefit from wider discussion some of the questions hovering around     it’s hard to proofread data in tiny cells how can i proofread effectively?how can i think critically about the available tools and sources and still get the work done on time? data collection issues are the root of some of these questions data was collected using inconsistent methods  some is firsthand from my site visits while other monuments were discovered in published secondary sources one solution is just coming to terms with the fact that i have better data for some monuments than others when cataloguing from other catalogs i cite the sources of course but it just occurred to me that i might want to make a note of my own site visits where applicable so that i can more clearly articulate whether i’m documenting firsthand or relying on others’ reports as @paregorios said during the big ancient mediterranean event at university of iowa this week don’t let perfection be the enemy of good  i’m paraphrasing that via @ctschroeder on twitter by the way keep an eye out for the #bam2016 storify and talks that will be posted online; as i followed along virtually they covered a lot of ground that resonates with #msudai ,
i apologize for the radio silence from denver! over the last few months i have been really busy trying to get the magic mountain project launched here at the denver museum of nature and science we are making some progress and it looks like we will be starting out first season of mapping and geophysics this august september! the larger community-based excavation project is still in the works and likely won’t launch until next summer but still progress is being made! because of logistics i had to shift my focus from creating a web platform for the developing project to focusing on crowdsourcing information from old site records to help get the collection from the 1990s we have at dmns online the crowdsourcing project was born out of the effort to make the magic mountain collection more accessible along with other dmns anthropology department members i am teaching a class through the university of colorado denver  special topics 501  this semester the class is processing and digitizing the collection so we can get it online through imu the online version of emu—the database program we use at dmns this mainly includes photographing objects scanning site forms creating localities and uploading and linking the localities forms photos and artifacts in the database there is a lot to do to get the collection digitally in shape since three numbering systems were used in the past there is only one master key that links these systems together and it is hand written  with tons of help of dan pett and micropastsorg i developed a way to crowd source the information from the master key although i have not advertised it nearly enough yet the website went live march 1st 2016 http   crowdsourcedmicropastsorg project magicmountain  since dan really really helped me along with getting this live i am now in the process of learning the process for myself i’ve spent a lot more time in codecademy and also learning about pybossa the crowdsourcing platform unfortunately i am unable to host this project on the dmns server so i will have to continue to use micropastsorg for the time being this may change in the future as i am talking with other potentially interested partners  i am planning a trip to harvard university in may and i hope that i can apply the same protocol to crowdsourcing the catalog cards from the magic mountain collection that is held there this will really give me the chance to apply the new skills i am learning with hopefully less help this next time around ,

i admit i am behind on the blog posts mainly because i have been writing grants working on several different projects and finishing up end of the semester grading and work the past two months have been somewhat slow in terms of moving forward on the project’s deliverables but i have been moving forward despite not having the site ready to go live these past two months have involved planning training and making connections beyond our lab at the university of idaho i attended a mukurtu webinar and then brought my collections manager dr leah evans-janke to an in-person training with michael wynne at washington state university’s center for digital scholarship and curation i also met with dr yolanda bisbee who is my university’s executive director of tribal relations to make a plan for moving one particular collection associated with a local tribe into mukurtu since that meeting i have contacted the collection’s affiliated tribe to set up a meeting to discuss this potential project all of this training and planning work has lead me to make a short-term plan for the current project and long-term plan for future projects the short-term plan is pretty much the same as what i proposed to do last year  to code a website for our lab that is housed on the university of idaho’s server it will provide basic information about our holdings and our facility the long-term plan is to move collections associated with specific tribes into mukurtu as our neighboring institution washington state university already has a mukurtu portal for local tribes we are going to work towards securing funding to support these efforts as of right now i am working on coding the website via bootstrap and then getting it online this will be my work for the coming months before our meeting in august,
sunset over the mississippi saturday feb 20  this post is coming somewhat late but i do have a good excuse; for the past week i've been down in natchez mississippi a small contingent of archaeologists traveled from unc in order to do a few things  fieldwork meet with the nps and present at the joint meeting of the maa  mississippi archaeological association  and las  louisiana archaeological society  this year is the tricentennial of the founding of natchez  more specifically when fort rosalie was built - 1716  which was the reason the conference was held in town the park service recently removed some houses and brush from the fort rosalie site so now you can get a clear view of what is left of the bluff and likely the last bit of fort rosalie the high points you see below likely contain bits of the 1732 pentagonal earthworks of the fort v2 the original square fort with bastions  which is the time period i'm depicting  was destroyed in 1729 in the natchez revolt; the second pentagonal fort was then rebuilt on top of the first   =attachment_2771 style=width  410px  alignright>the recently cleared remains of fort rosalie  this was perfect for me because it gave me an opportunity to meet with kathleen bond who is the superintendent of the natchez national historic park i met with her last march to discuss my plans for creating a 3d model of natchez so this was my opportunity to show her what i've created so far like most people i am my own worst critic so it was incredibly reassuring to see how excited she was - she actually called in everyone who was in the office at the time we also met with her a second time so their public interpretation officer and members of seac  southeast archaeological center  could look at what i had to offer while i have plans to create a much more interactive experience it's nice to know that what i have now is something that can already be used by the park to help draw people in to the site so what is it that i have now? my biggest goal for the presentation i gave at the conference was to have a flythrough of my recreation thus far which would provide everyone else an opportunity to see my project in more than just still shot form i've had two primary ways to go about this the first is an asset for unity called the camera path animator and the second is a unity community asset called the hermite spline controller the for-purchase asset  camera path  was originally created for an earlier version of unity and throws up some warning messages when i loaded it in - i don't think these are so serious that they would cause the asset to actually not work but i also haven't done much messing around with code yet the hermite spline controller being both free and throwing up no errors was thus what i chose for my test run it's also a bit simpler than the camera path animator  although more simple also means a little less in the way of functionality without adding in your own code  here is what i came up with ,
my goal in the next 30 days is to start pulling the pieces together for my website  the last two months have been busy! all the historic pictures of cave rock have been scanned from the early glass negatives that serve as a basis for the 3d recreations the project storyline has five timeframes for digital recreation that reflect changes in the appearance of cave rock over time  pre-1840  no roads  early wagon road with a distinctive hanging bridge the creation of the first tunnel creation of the second tunnel and the new 2016 appearance  i have had a couple of rabbit holes i've had to steer clear of  thank you ethan for discussing this topic!   i have declined to use several photos that i was not able to verify the rights on  i had to draw the line as to when to keep searching out historic photos  the four later time periods are pretty well represented with photos but the earliest period has required more 3d modeling to recreate the early appearance  the  final tiffs  created from the scans are super sharp but the aspect doesn't always lend well to draping while i work that issue out i've been drafting the background content for the website,
i plan to publish electronic catalog records for the historic fort snelling archaeology collections held by the minnesota historical society  mnhs  to open context  http   opencontextorg   to make them available for scholarly research specifically for use by university of minnesota research partner dr kathryn hayes and her students using the open context api i also plan to include selected records in a proof-of-concept mobile website designed to enhance public interpretation of the historic site mnhs curates over 600 cubic feet of collections generated during excavations conducted at the site between the mid 1960s and the early 1980s because this work took place in a largely pre-digital era the documentation consisted of paper records only the volume of material  and paper!  has resulted in limited access to and use of this valuable collection the archaeology department at mnhs received state grant funding in 2013 to inventory the fort snelling collections and make them more available for research a heritage collaborative partnership with the university of minnesota brought dr katherine hayes and her students into the lab to assist with the inventory over the last year approximately 85000 electronic records have been created to date as a result of this project the timing for the inventory and the institute for digital archaeology method and practice project couldn’t be better mnhs is currently working to expand the interpretation of the historic fort to tell stories of different eras in the fort’s history and of the various communities associated with it particularly the american indian and african american people the research dr hayes conducts over the next year and the mobile website will demonstrate how the results of archaeological research can serve as another primary source with the power to provide new insights and to enhance or contradict the other lines of evidence currently used for telling the stories of the site fort snelling history the united states government established fort snelling at the confluence of the mississippi and minnesota rivers in 1820 to protect american fur trade interests in the region and to gain a foothold in the western territory that would become minnesota the fort served various military functions until 1945 when the army discontinued use of the site  http   wwwhistoricfortsnellingorg history  in 1956 proposed construction of a highway through the middle of the historic fort created a public outcry although only four original structures remained standing interest in the site prompted mnhs to hire an archaeologist to determine if significant deposits remained below ground the answer was an unequivocal yes the highway was rerouted and mnhs acquired the property to serve as a living history museum by restoring the fort to its 1820s appearance research history the archaeological research at historic fort snelling necessarily focused on documentation of the structural remnants to inform reconstruction and most of the collections generated during the project received only cursory examination before being placed in storage for the current inventory project archaeology department staff and umn volunteers are in the process of recording catalog numbers for every artifact in a given box along with controlled vocabulary terms for material types and object names we also wanted to capture the artifact descriptions created by the original catalogers and the provenience data they recorded the paper catalogs were scanned as pdfs and added to a shared folder in google drive so that volunteers and staff could transcribe them into a matching google sheet whenever they had time both the inventory and original catalog data are being added to the mnhs collections management database while we are now creating electronic records for the fort snelling collections the results are only available to mnhs staff with access to the collections database sharing data proved challenging for example during dr hayes spring semester historic archaeology class when she hoped to give class members a chance to analyze materials from one of the enlisted men’s barracks publishing the fort snelling collections data in open context will solve our current file sharing problem at the same time that it makes the data available to anyone interested in research at the site we plan to start by publishing the data from the one of the enlisted men’s barracks – the one that dr hayes class examined – and we will add records from other buildings as they are completed interpretation at fort snelling initially interpretation at the fort was based upon the 1820s military experience over the years mnhs has presented more diverse and difficult stories to visitors i would like to show how the archaeological research can enhance interpretation by creating a mobile website that uses data from open context next week i will begin consulting with a program specialist who works at the fort to determine the best approach i want to create something that meets the needs of the mnhs historic sites and museums programs while spotlighting archaeology as a primary source for connecting with the past  nancy hoffman archaeology department minnesota historical society,
hi everyone! my name is ashley peles and i am currently a doctoral candidate at unc-chapel hill my research is based around understanding foodways through both floral and faunal analysis in particular my doctoral research involves the analysis of assemblages from three late woodland mound sites in the lower mississippi valley one of which dates between ad 400-700  baytown period  and two that date between ad 700-1200  coles creek period  part of my interest in digital archaeology stems from this work all or parts of these mounds have completely disappeared and what is left is seen in a drastically different setting than it originally would have been experienced on top of this mounds were built and added to at different times meaning that each site would have been experienced differently depending upon where we look in the site’s lifecycle with that in mind i have been interested for a long time in learning digital technologies that could help archaeologists create relatively accurate reconstructions of archaeological sites to facilitate learning such technologies i began a project last year as part of a year-long digital humanities fellowship that i am calling recreating natchez this project involves recreating a small portion of natchez mississippi during the french colonial period in 1729 the natchez indians reached their limit and burned the french settlement including fort rosalie to the ground in addition to the purposeful destruction of the settlement changes in the landscape have further altered archaeologists’ ability to investigate this early period perhaps the most pertinent in the case of fort rosalie is bluff-edge erosion  =attachment_2367 style=width  310px  alignright>postcard of the ruins of fort rosalie 1907 credit  courtesy of the mississippi department of archives and history  as with most forts fort rosalie was built on a high point along the bluffs bordering the mississippi river the soils that make up the natchez bluffs are called loess and are subject to large amounts of erosion when they become waterlogged based on our best estimates of the location of fort rosalie it appears that nearly all of the archaeological remains of the fort have been lost due to the changing bluff line  the disappearing site of fort rosalie is a common problem for archaeologists in this case we a well-drawn map created by the french engineer ignace francois broutin in 1723 while we can’t know exactly what the landscape looked like during the 1720s we can create a reasonable approximation of the bluff line using this map in conjunction with the arcgis program arcmap i have then been using unity3d as a platform to view this landscape in 3-dimensional space my plan is to add vegetation water and french buildings in order to repopulate at least the french side of the landscape as it might have looked immediately before 1729 ultimately i would like this landscape to be suitable to be viewed on a touchscreen console at the natchez visitor’s center and accessible to the national park service who owns the land where fort rosalie lays   a recreation however creates a common problem for archaeologists at this early period we do not know exactly what french colonial buildings looked like and we don’t want to falsely imply that we do i would like to take this ambiguity and use it as a learning experience using the colonial buildings as a prototype example i am proposing to create a pop-up window that walks a user through the information we currently know about early french colonial buildings during this process you would make choices about aspects of architecture; you would construct the building in the process of learning about it as a result there would be multiple versions of a french colonial building rather than one single static piece of architecture not knowing javascript well the interactive window scares me more than the unity process however as we have been told fail big and fail publicly therefore i plan on using this space to chronicle my work over the next year every month i will have a few tasks that i hope to figure out and hopefully by the time i write the next blog post i will have some words of advice about what works and what to avoid with that idea in mind here are the tasks i would like to cross off my list in the next month   •    finish the alpha version and begin the finalized version of the fort rosalie natchez landscape  alpha version is an entirely artificial reconstruction   •    figure out water in unity  harder than it seems when you have multiple streams flowing into a river   •    create wireframe flow chart for interactive window see you next month,
i’m trying to shift from my reliance on deadlines toward a more lean-based project management approach centered on efficiently completing tasks thanks to advice from one of my project mentors daniel pett the trick here is that i’m going to have to get pretty ruthless about scheduling institute project time i'm feeling like it's a little risky to try an unfamiliar way to organize my workflow but the principles of lean  namely not relying on a set schedule but completing small tasks in succession  make an incredible amount of sense from here on out i decree that with the exception of providing urgent assistance to customers tuesday will be repository day[i]  so while i’m moving away from schedules and deadlines i’m also finding it helpful to look at a very general calendar just so i know when i should be expecting to hit benchmarks and so i can watch out for danger zones as of this morning i’ve finally got my showcase projects selected here is a quick list of all the cool stuff that the repository and accompanying site will [likely] contain  read more,
first a little background… my name is ben carter and i am currently an assistant professor of anthropology at muhlenberg college in allentown pa however i came to the project described below long before i was lucky enough to get my current job my essential perspective was forged in the fires of many years in in-between states- as a graduate student an adjunct and a non-tenure-track faculty member at the same time i was trying to run a field school- because i believe in the fundamental pedagogical value of field school for those going into archaeology and for everyone else however because i operated in these in-between states i often had severe budget and time constraints initially i had hoped to employ digital tools in the field in order to save time thus allowing me to spend more time with my students discussing important anthropological issues and less time on data entry although i have field tested a range of options; none have done what i want them to do  and most cost me more time  indeed my students will tell you that these attempts while perhaps educational were quite frustrating   therefore broadly speaking my goal has been to develop a field data collection system that is inexpensive easy to deploy and use and results in data in a format that can be openly shared these characteristics would not only ensure my own ease of use but enable other archaeologists to give it a whirl the project should yield a product useful to graduate students faculty with severely limited resources community projects small crm firms and anyone else  beyond my own experience archaeologists have been shifting towards collecting data digitally in the field for some time these systems can be as simple as using an app on a smart phone or as complex as setting up a wifi network- including a server  laptop  and multiple data collection devices  such as ipads - in the field  we have done this largely to reduce both time spent converting paper-based data to digital as well as to reduce the errors introduced in this process also a digital collection system is simply the first stage of a digital pipeline that funnels data to both online publishing and archival platforms however many of the systems developed within archaeology have been hampered by five major concerns  first many employ proprietary software  filemaker pro is one of the best known  and or hardware that limit the integration analysis and open dissemination of data and restrict flexibility similarly once entangled in proprietary software and hardware it is extremely difficult to leave- at least partially because they have a steep learning curve second the cost of proprietary software and the devices needed to deploy it limit its applicability to  larger well-funded academic projects or crm companies smaller groups and individuals including small academic teams faculty at small less-well-funded schools graduate students and small crm firms cannot sustainably afford these systems even if the may be able to afford a one-time purchase third while proprietary software often supplies a wide array of options making it attractive they can neither provide all present requirements nor those that may be necessary in the future an open community-based tool can be relatively quickly re-purposed and modified to account for nearly any contingency- in the present or the future all this should be possible with minimal time investment and assistance from an open source community fourth most of these data collection systems require either a wireless local network or a connection to a cellular network so that the collection tool such as a tablet can communicate with the database on a server while this is logistically feasible for many  especially small localized  excavations they are not applicable to field survey for these tools to be used in field survey a cellular connection is required the tool we hope to design can be used offline and then synchronized with a database once a connection is established fifth while there are some serviceable open-source projects these are platform specific  eg faims is designed for android  we prefer a browser based system in order to avoid the problems associated with restricting tools to a particular platform we would like to build a field data collection system that is open inexpensive highly flexible browser-based and can be used offline we believe that this exists in a set of open-source software known as wqio the goal of my project- or rather our project for i am working with a fellow institute participant who will have a separate post and other partners are being courted- is to develop a tool that remedies these issues  we hope that the end product of this project is a tool that   1    is browser-based  and therefore device independent   2    can be used off-line  now possible with html5   3    employs open source code  4    can be connected to a database of choice  proprietary or open-source   5    is inexpensive and simple  at least on the user end once it has been built   6    promotes the open use of resulting data we realize that this is a bit of a pipe dream for we will never be able to do all of this in one year we plan to have a working prototype we are feverishly working to figure out the details- more on that in coming posts,
there’s not a lot to report since my last post other than continued progress on scanning materials and working to conceptualize the organization of both the digital repository and our banda through time project web site we’ve acquired a domain name  bandathrutimecom  and arranged for hosting through the university of victoria’s online academic community veronique plante my graduate student assistant and i have been consulting on wordpress templates and have narrowed down the choices with spring term classes now over i’m looking forward to having more time to devote to the project though my administrative obligations will continue to compete for attention as noted in my february post i’ve been thinking increasingly about the data archiving issues that we discussed at last summer’s gathering after participating in the february saa online seminar in advanced archaeological digital data management taught by folks from tdar i’ve been in touch with colleagues at the university of ghana and will be meeting with them and with staff at the ghana national museum during a june trip to ghana my hope is that conversations there will jump-start consultations on principles and begin to chart a path for how researchers working in ghana can collaborate to develop sustainable data archives that encompass both legacy and future collections i’ll be presenting a paper on our work through the msu digital archaeology institute at the meetings of the society of africanist archaeologists in toulouse france in june my hope is to use this as a platform for networking with other africanist archaeologists and encouraging others to join the conversation about how to ensure curation and expand access to digital data in african archaeology,
i initially thought that this was going to be an update where i described my failures perhaps i should back up a bit and start closer to the beginning however; a few weeks ago i attended a graduate research workshop as part of #chat16 a festival dedicated to bringing together all sorts of people to talk about new media in the arts and humanities it provided an opportunity that was somewhat similar to our msu gathering although on a much less intense scale i presented my project to get some more feedback about what some achievable goals might be particularly given my inexperience with coding in describing what i was hoping to do with popup windows we talked about how complex that coding can be like many other msudai members i've realized that an interesting and creative idea is not necessarily the same thing as an achievable idea with that in mind i've decided to scale back my goals a bit my primary goal has been to have my project be interactive given the large amount of space that i'm covering this is a little complicated breaking down that interactivity i see two primary access points     annotationsunity user interface tutorials  in a very long lynda tutorial that does a good job of getting you familiar with the how the various ui elements work on their own  unity 5  ui  and not so much in lots and lots of other videos i had a good sense of how to structure ui elements but nothing was showing me how to attach text to a button in a way that clicking the button would make text appear i can't tell you how frustrating this was - clickable elements that bring up text are a basic component of so many games! well apparently searching for the term popups is actually better than some form of event trigger text with button who would have known here is what ended up being the video that finally broke my stalemate  making a popup and closable panel in unity 5 really once you get everything attached to one panel the event can be triggered on the panel and voila you can make the text appear and disappear by attaching that functionality to ui buttons the rest of the functionality i was able to figure out with the help of a few more tutorials  creating an exit image for the close button and using onmousedown to create an interactable object   i've annotated my code with descriptions of what everything does  to the best of my knowledge  so that hopefully if i won't be able to forget why this works and other people might have an easier time following the logic plus that code and this post constitute my current record for being able to reproduce more popup annotations here's what the popup looks like ,
i've been thinking a lot about archaeological data and its transformation whether in the field or during  post-field' analysis more often than not we are transforming spatial temporal and thematic information  more recently as i've been working with records that someone else has made i keep coming back to how much do i trust this source? or more precisely how much do i trust the spatial temporal and thematic values that i have added to my spreadsheet? and how do i tell someone who isn't familiar with the source with archaeology and with academic writing what is trustworthy and what isn't? can i visually present this information? let me explain by example since my last post i've geocoded the data in the csv i went with chieko maene's excellent geocoding python script available here it calls arcgis and google apis  with the option to add api keys from others  grabs the coordinates and creates a new csv with the geocoder name i chose this script because i wanted to know what exactly the geographic coordinates refer to - the place name or the centre of the district or something else  maene's script returns coordinates for each place name and also what the location refers to such as the  building name'  street address' point of interest administrative unit etc mind you this doesn't mean that building name is the most accurate and administrative unit the least accurate it just means that the geographic coordinate i now have refers to that  thing' the  thing' is not always the place name i'm interested in in some cases i have coordinates for buildings and roads that share a name with the place name not awesome but at least i know this ie i have a way of assessing its accuracy  but what about the temporal information in the csv? how much do i trust periodization and the culture-historical period? i'm not so much concerned here with assigning each place name a date or date range a task that has its own challenges rather i am referring to the material culture that was analysed and upon which the archaeologist assigned the date date range was it based on the pottery stone metal bone tools other artifacts? was it on radiocarbon dating and what was the context of the analysed material? this sort of information  in the source i am working with  isn't always available or explicit enough to assess reliability it can be straightforward so harappan might refer to pottery  although the term can be used as a  trait'  and not so easily interpreted black-red-ware with lithics it is one thing to simply take what's written and faithfully put it into a spreadsheet it is another to encode information meaningfully  then of course there is thematic information and the many different ways of describing a thing a cromlech is different from a cairn but the criteria isn't clear  to me  so there's quite a bit of interpretation going on in just a simple csv tags might be a way around this but is it possible to present these metadata  imperfections and well especially the imperfections!  visually? it sure would be nice in the meantime i've started work in mapbox and as of last week i have web hosting courtesy of the matrix lab my next post will focus on the webmap continuing work on map interactivity and developing the website to house it,
at its heart the digital catalog of cappadocian ceiling crosses will be a database of my dissertation data deposited in open repositories and visualized for public dissemination as an interactive catalog of all known monumental ceiling crosses in byzantine cappadocia a region that is now central turkey cappadocian architecture offers one of the largest groups of late antique and medieval ceilings available for study because rock-hewn architecture is fairly durable and dozens of monuments survive in the region my dissertation’s underlying argument encourages readers to rethink the use of overhead space and monumental imagery  giant cross imagery placed overhead was designed to manipulate and inspire medieval christian viewers within the spaces beneath the first deliverable from this msudai project will be an open data deposit into two repositories called open context and kora  a secondary contribution will be made to pleiades an ancient world gazetteer of places  the data will then receive public-facing visualizations based on the repositories’ built-in features for instance open context has a graph option and kora data can be visualized in a wordpress site using the matrix connect plugin  theoretically the data could be endlessly remixed or visualized in alternate formats such as storymaps scalar or mbira but i’m taking ethan’s advice to keep the scope creep at bay!  variations of this project have been in the ether for a while as i’ve learned how to think of art history research as reusable data at lawdi  a previous neh-sponsored event called the linked ancient world data institute  i was able to recognize how this kind of project could take shape in the larger sphere of ancient world linked data with a goal of a pleiades contribution at my home institution several graduate center people and groups—the new media lab digital initiatives programs  including the digital fellows training funds that helped me get to the institute  mina rees librarians classmates and professors—have been incredibly generous with time advice and resources toward the digital project taking material shape with their help i’ve made some progress but several areas of decision-making have been stalled why you might ask would i need an archaeology institute to weigh in after all that good advice? the short answer is it takes a village to link some data a more nuanced answer would include the benefits of working with institute faculty members who not only know data but who have collected and cleaned and archived archaeological data themselves and who regularly think about the various levels of specificity  or lack thereof  in field recording another direct effect of msudai on this project the faculty’s knowledge of technologies content management systems and platforms that are designed or have long been utilized for archaeological data the aha! moment for me in my new workflow came with the the solution of the long-term archiving of data with a  somewhat  automated workflow into its public-facing visualization thanks to eric kansa’s suggestion before the institute i kept trying to hack the wordpress content management system to use as a database or to learn drupal  for its more sophisticated construction data and metadata from the back-end  and then deposit the data somewhere for archiving my new msudai approach is just the opposite  deposit the data in stable repositories and then use the repositories’ built-in tools to visualize it into wordpress  using the matrix connect plugin  or open context’s graphs feature that i can embed into a blog post with this workflow the data itself won’t be succeptible to updates  of browsers platforms software etc  from my end  as wordpress and omeka are  the work of visualizating it will be simplified and enhanced by using tools that are specifically designed to draw from my chosen repositories in a nutshell my first lesson learned from the capstone project is to start with a stable data deposit and then do all the fancy things with visualization in business or grant-reporting we’d call the data contribution my minimum viable product my goal is to document and share my decisions and workflow so that this project can serve as a template for other researchers who would like to contribute small data sets to the wider open data ecosystem al mcmichael @byzcapp  phd candidate in art history  the graduate center of the city university of new york  cuny,
there has been a hiatus in my blog posts and project because i encountered several problems with my site that i could not fix on my own as my last post indicated i was learning how to modify katy meyer’s modification of bootleaf ieldran for my own site paisajes this idea seemed so simple but it has not been for me i was able to read and interpret enough of her code to change fonts colors and text i could also see where the maps were supposed to go but when i tried to put my own in things got really messed up unfortunately i did not have the skill or time to figure out what was going on without specific guidance  i did try a few times and it just resulted in utter frustration and feelings of incompetence so i just stopped no one has time for that  thankfully i have the best mentor brian geyer a very hard-working graduate student at msu and coding master as it is for everyone the end of the semester was busy but as soon as he was free he spent several days in may and early this month helping me work through these problems i can't thank him enough!! problems and solutions 1  mapbox changed at the institute in the fall i had made several simple maps of my study area in the older version of mapbox when i returned to it this winter they had upgraded the program so i just assumed that i could re-make the maps in the new format and be fine well the new version is not that simple and i was creating styles not actual maps with the needed map id and i was plugging in the api  which is very easy to find on the new version of mapbox  into the code where the map id should have been this stopped my progress in march but it seems there were other issues too  see below  in the end brian had me use my original classic mapbox maps where the map id is clearly visible but because i had been working in the newer version i also had to add some information  my api  to the code to help it find those maps the maps were not showing up on the page even though i had the map ids in the correct locations in case anyone is running into this issue take a look at the code on my github under the note created by katy   basemap layers  as of this post line 599 and below  2  problems with ieldran code  i thought at the time  march  that the mapbox changes were my biggest problem and nearly abandoned it and ieldran all together and trying another program after commiserating with neha at the saas after discussing with brian  again  he convinced me that i had already done a lot with ieldran and should stick with it so i did the bigger problem was actually some basic issues with the code which i did not have the knowledge to identify myself once brian emerged from his busy semester he was able to help me fix it we did this through slack because he found that code was not being displayed properly on the digital commons site  where i had been posting all of my questions and he the responses  so over two lengthy meetings he and i worked through several issues with the code which ranged from fixing calls to the stylesheets to changing minor punctuation i could not have figured any of that out on my own! thanks to the help of brian though we got the page running again and we could turn to the maps if you go to the site now  link above  you will see that it's displaying the taraco peninsula!! if you click on the layers tab you can see different versions of the maps  which i'm still working on  next steps my next goal is to get some data  the location of archaeological sites  to show up on the map brian and i started working on that  i learned how to turn my cvs file into a geojson  but it seems the site is having an issue reading my data because they are in utm coordinates i’m going to have to convert them to lat long and try loading it up again i leave for fieldwork in bolivia on monday so my progress will again slow down but i hope to be able to a bit of work on this while there i also hope to show it to my bolivian colleagues and the taraco community members to get their feedback on the project and how i might make it more useful to them,
i decided to get the basic framework of the underwater maya web page operational so i can continue to multi-task on various aspects of the digital project i used html css and bootstrap to enter code on notepad++ here i will describe the format  the bar across the top of the page has the title underwater maya and three links  updates maps and diva lab updates are planned to be blogs by various project members about the research currently updates links to a 3d scan of a partial vessel on adobe 360 a free 3d viewer the image can be moved resized and turned around the maps link currently takes you to a static qgis map of paynes creek salt work 74 wooden architecture&#8212;post distributions this is where i plan to have maps site 74 will be the pilot study the diva lab link takes you to the diva lab web page on lsu's geography and anthropology department wordpress site the page needs updating but i don't control it the next section  style= jumbotron  is a photo of punta ycacos lagoon with a title ancient maya wooden buildings discovered below the sea floor there is a link  where the color changes if you hover  that says preserved by 3d scanning  that takes you to the diva lab facebook page which i do control below the phot is a container with 4 photos each with text i have had trouble keeping the photos the same size so i added additional text the footer has copyright and links to facebook and twitter next i will continue to work with qgis which i like more than cartodb because qgis accepts my utm coordinate data directly  without converting into long lat  i also will work on selecting 3d scans and may move to sketchfab for this project instead of adobe 360 i also will select images movies and stats in the upcoming weeks ,
after an amazing hackathon where i had a chance to mine for text and images in web archives and several weeks of working through weekends on various commitments  ie co-editor responsibilities manuscript revisions and the like  i fell sick the silver lining in not being able to look at a screen for more than five minutes was that i had time to think about what i currently have and where i am going with mina what i have   1  geocoded archaeological investigations between 1953-1960  csv with additional attribute information on the the nature of investigation lead archaeologist and team their institutional affiliation the culture-historical period of the material culture and reference to the original publication i may go ahead and geocode the 1990s set that i have as well  2  git repository of the digital atlas of egyptian archaeology  taking ethan’s suggested workflow i have downloaded the daea repo and i will use it as a template for mina i like daea’s clean and simple layout i have started playing with its ‘look and feel’ and its functionality specifically it draws on point data from a csv and uses mapbox  via leaflet  for map tiles mina will have an identical setup the daea map is centred on egypt and uses arabic for geographic terms archaeological sites are indicated on the map using blue point markers users interact with the map by clicking on the point a click will result in a pop-up window with a description of the site this is relatively straightforward when there are a few well-spaced out markers mina will differ in geographic scope of course i also know that there a lot more points that will make things messy so i will likely need to try out a few things with clustering symbology i also would like to have additional map interactivity i want users to be able to filter the csv based on say one institution or a particular archaeologist the same could be applied for culture-historical period or any other attribute in the csv  3  git repository for mina i have setup the mina repo here there is very little there at the moment other than a landing page there will be more!  4  mapbox i’ve been experimenting with mapbox particularly the default symbology and layer control the overview will be national ie the whole of india  zoom level 5  which looks ok but in the default zoom level 5 i can’t see any rivers i realized that the waterways layer in mapbox is locked for a high zoom level and that means rivers are visible only as you zoom into a smaller area i decided the best way to show rivers was to make my own geojson i checked the metadata documentation on open street map and used overpass-turbo to grab the relevant waterway  =river  of course the simple way was to use the metadata to filter and select all rivers which worked but the resulting file was too large to process and download on a browser i decided to get only the nodes for major rivers and this made download way  way way way  easier on mapbox the resulting geojsons look decent but i can see a few gaps a little tweaking will set it right  =attachment_2911 style=width  1034px  aligncenter>fig 1 major rivers in northern india extracted from open street map  and here is the same shot for rivers in southern india  =attachment_2914 style=width  1034px  aligncenter>fig 2 major rivers in southern india extracted from open street ma,
the past few weeks have been spent in public engagement for the reconstruction project for cave rock the interested party consultations surrounding the reconstruction project have been much more active and focused  cave rock is very important to the washoe tribe of nevada and california and the nevada department of transportation regularly attend tribal meeting on the stabilization project  the rock itself is on ground administered by the us forest service and the highway that goes through the tunnels is part of the historic transcontinental lincoln highway route  our project team is simultaneously working closely with the state historic preservation office to complete the highway context and nominate cave rock for inclusion into the nrhp like so many of us i am having to struggle to fit the digital project into my workload;where did february go?  =attachment_2906 style=width  687px  alignnone>view from the top of cave rock taken in the 1920's showing the lincoln highway winding around lake tahoe  glass negative collection   the photos from the glass negative collection are being supplemented by additional highway department photos to recreate the landscape after the first tunnel was constructed in 1930  after reading everyone's posts  which are so helpful!  i've realized it is time to break off the digital research and refocus on building the website,
so it turns out that my most intractable barrier to progress in this institute is a work practice developed over too many years of typical academic work  polishing an idea or a paper by myself until it's ready for public display this is amusing given that i am used to collaborating in a lab or at a conference and or workshop in fact i prefer it to solitary reflection it is certainly much more productive publishing seems to set off a polishing frenzy that for some can lead to eternally putting off submission publishing online where revision is public makes it impossible for one to reach that point of perfection behind a curtain this all sounds very obvious but i am unaccustomed to social media and its new link to scholarly production in the context of the institute on digital archaeology method and practice so most of my time so far has been dedicated to polishing a selling document to send to colleagues to consolidate their participation i only just realized that both the polishing and the promotion have to happen in concert  i think  i need to rethink how to delegate and collaborate - we are no longer going to be working independently to at some point join a document together we have to divvy up work in different ways - the productive process has to be more explicit this digital environment for someone as unaccustomed as i implies larger shifts in how one works than i expected the reason why i took on this project was to facilitate communication and debate but also to create publishing environments that represent and involve all the authors of a text i also hoped that the digital environment would represent a place where contradictory ideas and interpretations might co-exist more readily it might also help make more explicit the reconciliation of such opposing views  okay that's a bit idealistic!  i think i have to launch myself out further in order to help this become a reality rather than perpetuate old practices,
over the past several months my work on this project has been a cycle of experimenting for a few days getting frustrated and trying to figure out how to make this grand scheme of mine into a manageable project  fig 1  i have also worried that this project's broad goal might be a distraction from my dissertation after a lot of thinking i think i've come up with a pretty good compromise moving forward  =attachment_2634 style=width  310px  alignnone>figure 1 i have no idea what i'm doing visual aide requested by faculty so don't blame me  as you might remember my original goal was really big i wanted to create a hub for aggregating uploading sharing saving and annotating archaeology teaching materials basically i wanted a scholarly citation-oriented version of pinterest that could facilitate collaboration among public archaeologists my mentors rightly pointed out that i need a more detailed plan to build an audience and it would be beneficial to have institutional support to ensure the project can last beyond this year these are challenges that will take more than five months to address so i have begun work on a digital heritage project which shares some of the same technological and theoretical goals but is much more manageable in size  the pocumtuck heritage online exhibit my new more focused project i will work on is a wrap-up of a long-term project currently led by my advisor dr siobhan hart and dr elizabeth chilton over the past twenty years archaeologists from the university of massachusetts amherst have been investigating likely locations of the historically noted pocumtuck fort the last ten years of these investigations have been conducted as a poly-communal heritage project involving local historical organizations government agencies indigenous peoples and avocational archaeologists in the decision-making process at this stage the project is in the reflection phase and as part of my dissertation i am creating an online hub for the project this sounds very different from my original msudai project - aggregating and facilitating dynamic interaction with educational materials - but it turns out it isn't working under the supervision of dr hart i am creating a website which both presents and represents the critical heritage work undertaken by the researchers at umass we are not just posting copies of publications that anthropologists and other stakeholders wrote we are constructing an online exhibit which prompts the user to construct a historical narrative based on the pieces of information they find compelling from these various sources  technical focus shift in my original msudai project i needed to understand how to create a website where users could mix match and save individual lesson plans to their own folder of sorts i also needed to master grabbing content from other websites maintaining links to those files over the long term and continually drawing in an audience to interact with them these many challenges each deserve significant attention in the current project i am able to focus on structuring and presenting content that i already have to build a truly interactive experience technically this will allow me to narrow down on a few skills such as programming in php and creating a custom wordpress theme; i think? i'd also like to experiment with annotation like hypothesis if i have the time so far i have created a mock-up of a navigation diagram and an adobe illustrator design for a front page the next few weeks i will make more mock-ups purchase a domain and start studying php and digital curation hopefully next month i will have exciting visuals to show my progress! until then here is an inspirational gif  fig 2    =attachment_2635 style=width  255px  alignnone>figure 2 defeat is not an option in this digital archaeology institute,
the 'berlin key' highlights the social dimension of technology  as an archaeologist i often talk about how objects have agency they can make us move act and think in particular ways  the ‘berlin key’ for example forces users to lock doors whenever they are closed  see bruno latour s work  monuments make us remember certain people and events in very particular ways many anthropologists now argue that in fact we are all already cyborgs - the lines have been blurred between humans and material culture technology  there have also been some fantastic discussions recently about digital materiality and digital  things' this concept has implications for the ways in which we understand our relationship to digital technologies archive and preserve virtual things and study and discuss them  these digital objects then certainly have agency too  =attachment_3155 style=width  310px  alignright>colleen morgan's tweet about digital media having materiality   this is a story about digital objects controlling digital archaeologists this past month my work on the monumental archive project which seeks to build a platform for accessing and sharing monumental and cemetery records has been focussed on bringing it all together in the past year there have been small steps along the way - creating an interactive map of collections working on controlled language and linked data cleaning data etc etc the time has come to weave together all of these loose digital threads  which have admittedly gotten a bit tangled along the way  yesterday was one of those rare moments where design and code seem so entrancing so captivating that i suddenly found myself sitting in a pitch black room hours had passed by my playlist had ended at some point and i had never put anything else on the door which was ajar to let a warm summer breeze in was now allowing the icy air of twilight enter the house  given that coding is generally the most painful and frustrating part for me all these signs pointed to the fact that i had accomplished some excellent work feeling a rare sense of satisfaction i hit the button to commit changes to sync and to refresh my page and see the results of my focussed efforts  i was startled by the strange creature that appeared before me         screen shots of the website  work in progress using templates mapbox and my own modifications  i looked at the screen and then at my initial sketch of the website and then back at the screen they looked almost nothing alike digital things like all things have agency the bootstrap template and a few snippets of code that i had borrowed had agency even with my modifications their underlying structure resulting from particular histories and design had remained intact and seemingly all powerful i had fallen into a zombie-like trance become  unconsciously  complacent and slotted my content into a template that was designed for something entirely different  i can now only marvel at what power templates have over us! they structure our content reframe the way that we originally conceived of a project and can present something entirely different to the public in turn manipulating the way that they see our work and our data sometimes for better sometimes for worse  this is not a ‘down with templates’ moment and i am not about to stop using code developed by skilled minds that have come before me however it is worth ruminating from time to time on the impact that those choices to borrow have on what we create and how it will be utilised in future even without templates the ways in which computer programming languages function the apps that have been designed to make it easier to do what we do the platforms that make it possible to share our data they all have their own level of agency they influence innovation and the creative process and in so doing have critical legacies for the future of digital archaeology,
the easiest thing to do to manage a project like this is to create a project map have flow diagrams and show everything needed to accomplish a task who is going to help with that task and a deadline of course i haven't done this  not for the lack of good advice  but we do know all that needs to happen so after the panoscanning was completed we decided to focus on pulling the data together and determining which artifacts would be used to render into 3-d and place on exhibition inside the virtual museum unfortunately over six years of excavation we have changed how we store collected information and things have not be uniformly cataloged so on to the next task;verifying the artifact information and ensuring there is a photograph and that they are included in a database that visitors to the virtual museum will be able to access and utilize we have chosen filemaker pro to house the information that will eventually have links that will allow people to see what we found in each test unit and level and interpret the findings a group of us headed over to catalina island for the weekend to pull artifacts and reorganize besides myself the group included pciap co-director karimah kennedy-richardson csun student edgar alvarez csun grad student austin ringelstein csula grad student lindsay jacoby and grad student jennifer kraft  =attachment_2839 style=width  310px  aligncenter>cataloging artifacts from eagles nest lodge  by the end of our work weekend we managed to go through over 700 artifacts match or take photographs use consistent terminology to identify the materials and provide missing data a screen shot of our work is provided below the next steps are to finalize which objects will be rendered in 3d continue to speak with people that worked and visited eagles nest lodge during the years to understand how each room looked and functioned recreate the rooms embed objects and access access to the data there is plenty more that a nice diagram would help pull together as well perhaps that might be useful after all  =attachment_2840 style=width  1034px  alignnone>eagles nest lodge artifact catalog ,
my goal in the next 30 days is to start pulling the pieces together for my website  the last two months have been busy! all the historic pictures of cave rock have been scanned from the early glass negatives that serve as a basis for the 3d recreations the project storyline has five timeframes for digital recreation that reflect changes in the appearance of cave rock over time  pre-1840  no roads  early wagon road with a distinctive hanging bridge the creation of the first tunnel creation of the second tunnel and the new 2016 appearance  i have had a couple of rabbit holes i've had to steer clear of  thank you ethan for discussing this topic!   i have declined to use several photos that i was not able to verify the rights on  i had to draw the line as to when to keep searching out historic photos  the four later time periods are pretty well represented with photos but the earliest period has required more 3d modeling to recreate the early appearance  the  final tiffs  created from the scans are super sharp but the aspect doesn't always lend well to draping while i work that issue out i've been drafting the background content for the website,
­my msudai project requires me to tackle a thorny problem i have faced for some time – how to get archaeology data out of the database used to manage collections at mnhs into a form that is easy for researchers to use creating an xml version of my project data set seemed like the answer to my problem until i realized the formatting issues that have dogged me on previous attempts were still there the bane of my existence has been a data structure called nested tables; tables embedded in other tables a deep dive into open refine’s advanced features made it clear to me that this was not the tool i needed to un-nest these fields that’s when i realized that i would have to use xslt to solve my problem i have never learned xml programming so where to turn for help? since i knew that other institutions that use the same collections management system have likely faced this problem i decided to review the user’s group forum bingo! a kind user in australia offered to write the xsl for me when i asked for examples of reports he mentioned in the forum the code hasn’t run properly yet but i am very close now to the results i want the current convergence of research at historic fort snelling is really inspiring i met with two mnhs staff members from the exhibits department and program specialist matt cassady to discuss how archaeology in general and my project in particular could enhance interpretation of the fort as the history there is reexamined ahead of planned redevelopment of the site  http   wwwmnhsorg hfs2020  archaeology has not been on the institutional radar before so i am starting to reach part of the internal audience i hoped to engage with my msudai project matt and i met  to review themes suggested by the artifacts music in the military is one topic we have started to explore because the basement of the short barracks was littered with keys from brass instruments these were not found elsewhere on the site matt noted that this is consistent with documentation indicating band members were quartered in the short barracks  i also met with a group of non-mnhs researchers who will be conducting projects at the fort over the next year my university of minnesota partner professor kathryn hayes plans to hold a field school at the fort this spring one of her graduate students is scanning maps associated with the reconstruction excavations that i may be able use in the interpretive part of my project another student will start analyzing the short barracks data when it is ready a statewide archaeology survey grant will also fund a contractor to investigate aspects of the fort snelling historic district outside the historic fort  http   wwwcommmediastatemnus bookstore stateregister 40_10pdf p283  this work should help the historic preservation archaeologist update the national register nomination all people who could use the data i plan to publish,
this project is called the middle kingdom at the teti pyramid cemetery it will act as a supplement to my dissertation research a study of social identity using middle kingdom mortuary material from the teti pyramid cemetery at saqqara in the form of digital appendices the mortuary data that will comprise these appendices come from archaeological reports published from 1906 and 2009; archival data for these excavations have either been restricted or lost the data itself is some 56 graves the appendices will be organized into three parts  1  the burial 2  the body and 3  grave goods they will include both qualitative and quantitative data for each middle kingdom grave this project will be significant because it pulls together and organizes the corpus of middle kingdom mortuary data from the teti pyramid cemetery which up until this point has only been available as inconsistent narratives in published reports the project will also important because it can serve as a model for other scholars dealing with similar material the most valuable contribution however will be the project’s use of new technology the middle kingdom at the teti pyramid cemetery project will utilize digital technology developed by matrix of michigan state university in particular this project will use the kora data management system in conjunction with a wordpress plugin to publish it online the ideal result from the project is that anyone with an internet connection can view and explore these digital appendices future directions would ideally include contributions from other middle kingdom egyptian cemetery projects to study topics such as regional trends,

over the last 2 years i have been compiling a database of copper artifacts from across northern north america with a specific focus on arctic and subarctic contexts from the northwest territories and nunavut canada this dataset builds upon an already substantial database of copper artifacts from alaska yukon and british columbia that my adviser  dr h kory cooper  and another colleague  garett hunt  have been compiling like all archaeological collections this database will never be ‘complete’ but it is certainly a comprehensive representation of copper metallurgy across arctic and subarctic north america in the arctic most objects date to the thule period although a significant subset are from the late dorset period and some that are likely older still in the subarctic from alaska across to hudson’s bay copper becomes incorporated into toolkits by 1000 ad in both of these broad contexts copper objects appear to function as utilitarian items  knives awls spear points etc  although the line between utilitarian items and prestigious ritualized items is fuzzy at best in contrast however copper technology from british columbia falls on the prestige side of the prestigious-utilitarian spectrum dating to roughly 2000 bp marpole copper objects from british columbia are associated with elite burial contexts  the goal of my project for the institute is to organize this broad dataset in such a way that enables our current research team and other interested researchers now and in the future to be able to build upon the work that has already gone into the construction of the database this can serve as a complimentary and comparative dataset to investigations of great lakes copper artifacts iron metallurgy across the arctic and the early stages of metallurgical technology in other centers of metallurgical innovation around the world if done correctly the project has the potential to be integrated with these datasets as well either through their addition into the project or through linking datasets in an open access digital forum the project may also serve as a source of contextual information as well including information on analytical methods bibliographic references and other media related to investigations of archaeometallurgy such as videos and images,
the ordinary tavern project  otp  can claim its own web space located at ordinarytavernprojectwordpresscom the website is currently active as a softlaunch but the website will continue to be under construction until the conclusion of otp once complete this site will offer several static pages of information relating to the park property topics will include  a general history of the tavern and a review of the archaeological work that has been completed at the property the website will include a link to an interactive tour of the site which will allow visitors to view portions of the building and participate in various stages of an archaeology dig at the conclusion of the project the website will be handed off to ocean county parks and recreation it for continued management at the conclusion of otp,
i am writing this blog post from a familiar spot - that frustrating feeling you get in most research worth doing where you reach the end of your competency and aren't sure what to do next i am stuck i am the kind of person who is more likely to blog about the process rather than the content of my project anyway but it just do happens that this month my content hasn't taken on any new shapes anyway i have found that in these digital projects there is an ebb and flow instead of a constant pace since last month's update i've been fretting about whether i chose the right approach to my project did i choose the right way to build it? am i doing things in a good order? i was lucky enough to have a phone conversation about these questions with dr karen shelby one of the founders of art history teaching resources  =attachment_2865 style=width  610px  alignnone>screenshot from art history teaching resources website  we discussed how their project evolved and where they started from she and her collaborators have built an online hub for syllabi regular news and a platform for collaboration among teachers using wordpress over the past several years but they started with just syllabi carefully editing teaching plans and displaying them in a clean way  importantly contributors are given both editorial and financial support when they work with ahtr given our discussions of digital and teaching labor issues in the digital archaeology commons this was great news  my conversation with karen showed me a bit of a path forward from being stuck  i need to get something high quality online and slowly build in additional features it can and should be small i do not need to try to make every technological function work right now even if it makes the online presence of this project more in line with the theoretical goals of the researchers so my next step will be to load basic content into my domain using the basic site navigation agreed upon by myself and my supervisor i'll use this content for testing my theme code and to explain to my supervisor  and you all!  my progress i can do that easily and make noticeable progress because the php code is the thing making me feel overwhelmed the next step is learning php i could use code from the pinterest clones i downloaded to build my own basic theme or i could wade into the territory of paring down a quite fussy pinterest clone which is likely to result in a lot of broken functions either way i'd better learn php so i can achieve this goal i think my best bet for busting through this rut will be to set aside two days for working only on this project like a boot camp my goal this month is to have a 1-2 day boot camp where the result is my being able to understand the code of one of the pinterest clones i downloaded see you next month with my first working model of the website,
cave rock located at lake tahoe in nevada is an important landscape feature to the communities of the tahoe basin and the focus of my institute project  the prominent rock outcrop extends down from the tahoe basin rim into the water and is a sentinel feature with important cultural associations both in the past and present  several early 20th century lincoln highway tunnel projects were completed through the rock without input from the native american that traditionally lived at lake tahoe who believe that the rock cannot be altered without spiritual repercussions early last year a rock slide on cave rock further altered the traditional appearance and additional work will be needed to stabilize the rock face from future falls  this digital archaeology project will bring together the digital data being collected for that project and the historical photos taken before the highway tunnel projects recreating the appearance of the rock before the alterations the historic photographs will be meshed over digital surfaces captured using several 3d technologies and will be available to the public on a website  website visitors will be able to interact with the 3d  and 4d  objects experiencing the changes to the landscape over time and will hopefully leave with a sense of the story of cave rock remember that last scene from the first indiana jones movie?  the lost ark was boxed and stored in a dusty warehouse to be forgotten  the cave rock project is a wonderful chance to take information not readily available to the public and renew our view into the past  the hands-on training in digital methods and techniques through the institute on digital archaeology method and practice open up new horizons for returning legacy data to the spotlight instead of leaving the past on a forgotten shelf  i am looking forward to challenging our use of digital data this year and probably failing and backing up a few times as i piece together the story of cave rock both literally and figuratively beth smith lead archaeologist nevada department of transportatio,
before i get to the ominous part let me outline some progress    i have support from our archivist1 understanding copyright fair use and licensing as they apply to gray literature and this repository this is one of those issues that felt embarrassing to admit but probably shouldn't be because so many custodians of information in digital form are just dealing with it for the first time there i was happily perking away looking at pdfs when it hit me wait do i  on behalf of my agency  have the legal authority to put this report online? we didn't write it should we technically even be scanning all of these? crap as i journeyed down the rabbit hole of copyright fair use and open government data i just got more nervous and didn't really find good answers and to be honest it's the kind of question i'm afraid of asking too much about at work since being unsure enough if we could get sued could really easily put the kibosh on the whole project if the right people got nervous so i developed a hypothesis based on the tiny amount i grasp about the subjects reports written by the department of historic resources as a government agency are easy they should by default be publically accessible  also included here are reports written by other government entities  reports written by private firms? a little trickier if they were a part of our working files  think section 106 environmental review etc  then they would plausibly be good to go right  but there's that feeling again; ? i got in touch with joshua wells from the dinaa project since he's been working on issues related to redistributing government archaeology data for some time i emailed him my panicked series of questions and awaited a response lo and behold he confirmed my assumptions even though the legal details are still kind of nebulous hearing validation from someone who definitely knows what he's doing was very helpful but we do have a lot of material that doesn't fall into these categories  documents submitted as a courtesy by firms authors and other organizations sometimes organizations just find really old reports and send them to us i'm still not sure what to do with those the good news is that at least we've got some direction for metadata to collect moving forward as well as policies to adopt  allowing dhr to publish versions of documents online when submitted to our archives for any reason  to sum it up for my msudai project i'll definitely be working with the low-hanging fruit but my agency is going to have to get a handle on these issues for everything sooner or later and since i'm hoping my msudai project will turn into something bigger we have to start addressing this immediately  2 site location sensitivity fear that release of data could cause harm to sites this is a tale of false dichotomies all jumbled up with justified caution from an egocentric perspective i'm the manager of archaeological information for the state i'd prefer if my lasting legacy were not she's the one who released all the data and caused the destruction of virginia archaeology as we know it hyperbole for sure but looting is no joke around here to a great degree i argue that aside from specific coordinate locations releasing archaeological information to the public has the potential to do more good than harm through creating awareness and value but this is kind of just a touchy-feely hunch right? what happens if i'm wrong and we lose a site? do we need to risk breaking the eggs to make the omelet? ugh but again i'm getting a bit ahead of myself as it applies to the msudai project i've got the luxury of being really choosy about the kinds of information to include in this repository i know the answer is just to put one foot in front of the other and get some material into the system  3  fear of perpetuating inequality of access and representation since my msudai repository is small and just a proof-of-concept scale for now i know i don't need to come up with a solution to this big issue immediately but it's giving me great discomfort when we  as dhr as archaeologist as whoever  make the choice as to what the public sees or doesn't see that's an act of power i can decide that i'm not going to include any records about human burials or sacred objects but where do i draw the line? am i just talking about indigenous material culture here or should these principles be more broadly applied? when i choose to exclude material because it may be sensitive am i not then choosing to exclude compelling information about already underrepresented people? there are a lot of structural issues at play that make my asking these questions risky but that's another post entirely &#8212; besides swirling around inside my own brain about these questions i have actually made tangible progress on selecting materials i compiled a big long list of all the data recovery-level reports we have at dhr and sent it as a google forms survey to a bunch of colleagues just to get some help prioritizing some of the material when i had my list of~300 reports i really saw what an embarrassment of riches we have here it gave me a hopeful feeling that balanced out all the aforementioned trepidation i've got a couple of projects selected for the first round i'm having them rescanned and i'm also in the process of picking around to see if i can find any supporting media to digitize i'm hashing out metadata schema based on what we've been recording all this time combined with dublin core it might be helpful for me to be able to peek into an established kora back end to look at some schema that are already set up to make sure i'm on the right track but i'm feeling pretty good about everything my goal this week is to upload some actual assets and see how they work together and i'll get some sleep,
forgive me fellow digital archaeologists for i have sinned i am a week late in my msu dai blog post at the time of the deadline i was in the throes of my phd thesis viva  aka defense  and was wholly and completely entrenched in the process however given that the basis for my msu dai project is based in part on my thesis project the process re-centered my focus on why i am doing this my digital project was inspired by a concern with the practice of recording cemetery monuments but never sharing the  records despite their historical value this was at least in part informed by my doctoral research experience during which i became increasingly aware of those that had come before me there were partial records online and in the islands archives there were rumours of other archaeologists ‘doing the same thing as me’ last month last season last year  =attachment_2999 style=width  1034px  aligncenter>fieldwork in st andrew's churchyard barbados 2013  at the same time since starting this project i have had many voice their concerns about sharing my database before i have published ‘everything i intend to publish’ for fear of others swooping in and stealing my thunder however if i did wait until the point at which i had extracted every last piece of publishable narrative from the database before letting any one else get access to it i would likely face retirement or even my own mortality without sharing it i genuinely believe that this database and others like it can be used in so many different ways and by so many different people i find it altogether unlikely that anyone will ask the same questions in the same ways  which of course is a primary argument for proponents of open data and open access more generally  during my viva as we discussed plans for publication i was struck by the fact that there was no discussion of data sharing access and public engagement but rather academic venues and interpretive narratives having discussed this issue with other recent phd students i found that many had a similar experience  though happily there were some exceptions  i think this is a missed opportunity to engage early career archaeologists in discussions of impact public engagement and contemporary publishing practices getting back to my msu dai project i spent some time on the transatlantic flight home ruminating on the public nature usability and framing of the web-based platform to ensure that my goals were still aligned with my methods although i have had to put data archiving on the back burner until i have funding and have adjusted the scope of the database to be achievable at this time the values of open data relevance to wider audiences and connections between data and research are still heavily at the core of my project by next blog i hope to have more of the website built and accessible for feedback including the controlled vocabulary section and research forum,
my name is wendy giddens teeter curator of archaeology at the fowler museum at ucla as an archaeologist i am a co-director of the pimu catalina island archaeology project  pciap  this blog is to document the creation of a website to present our work at eagles nest hunting lodge on catalina island aside from excavation at this historic location our mission is to understand and protect the more than 8000 years of cultural history on the island while working with the gabrielino tongva community and local islanders with more than 100 years of previous archaeological research we hope to build off these undertakings and support new research projects using new methods knowledge and technology please see pimuweeblycom for further information  =attachment_2437 style=width  506px  aligncenter>eagles nest in the 1920s   project description  eagles nest hunting lodge was built in 1896 by joseph and hancock banning as a hunting camp and stagecoach stop it has gone through many transformations as ownership of the island changed to william wrigley in 1919 and then to the catalina island conservancy in 1972 archaeological excavations by pciap occurred from 2008-2014 to assist with mitigation of the california environmental quality act and to further contextualize the history of the location in preparation of the lodge becoming an historical museum a virtual presence pciap has unpublished data archival photos stories and historical items and will create a virtual exhibition and provide public access to the raw data while also providing a summary of our findings and how it enhances understanding of three major components in the life of this building  banning wrigley conservancy  i will be blogging about the creation of this website with the struggles and surprises that i expect it to bring more specifically this digital project will create a virtual museum exhibition that allows the visitor to select a time period  1890s 1930s 1970s  and then explore the hunting lodge and what life was like within that temporal framework in addition there will be an archaeological component that shows our site map  showing our excavation units  that can be clicked each unit will have highlighted images along with the official inventories so that people could play with the data and make their own interpretations this could feed into a k-12 component there are three thousand people that live on catalina island and more than a million visitors yearly many of these islanders and visitors are multi-generational and have specific memories of eagles nest either as a holiday location hunting area or as a tourist stop where they received lemonade coffee and cookies inland island tours still stop here generating a great deal of interest into its history although there is currently no information that focuses on the history of the eagles nest hunting lodge and how it exemplifies the vision each land owner had for the island partners the pimu catalina island archaeology project  pciap  has never worked on its own it is with  generous support and assistance of many people that the project continues to be so successful  excavations at eagles nest have been through field courses sponsored by ucla cotsen institute of archaeology ucla law school’s tribal learning community and educational exchange institute for field research and csun anthropology our permit is from the catalina island conservancy ongoing support is being given by the catalina island museum fowler museum at ucla usc archaeology usc spatial sciences usc environmental studies and wrigley marine institute and the city of avalon,
since my previous update on the northern indigenous copper database i have come to some important realizations about the scope of my project particularly in light of all of the other priorities that require my attention and time that i am sure everyone is dealing with  most importantly i have realized some of my limitations in digital skills particularly when venturing into unfamiliar territory  i have spent a substantial amount of time over the past month trying to understand the software that i had chosen as the framework of my project - nunaliit  although this initially seemed like the ideal tool to use i have been repeatedly stymied by the  apparently not so  simple task of downloading and installing the software to assess it  after much trial and error and some back and forth with developers on the nunaliit github i eventually was able to install the program but have very little understanding of how to use it and very little remaining patience and time to figure it out  so far all of my interactions with nunaliit have been though the command line and i am simply not knowledgeable enough to move forward with my project in this manner  although in some respects it feels as if i am back to square one i feel more invigorated now to move forward with creating my project without being restricted by the choice to use nunaliit  i'm sure it would work perfectly well for what i want to do but it is not the right program for me right now  the decision to ditch nunaliit and choose a different software will also allow me to learn from the trials and errors  and successes  of the rest of msudai with that being said the task at hand now is to choose a more user-friendly program to move forward with  as it seems many other workshop participants have done i am currently thinking that i will go back to ieldran as a basic framework on which i can use to base the nicd  although i would like some differences in functionality i would imagine that the combined power of bootstrap and leaflet will provide me with enough options to create a product that i am happy with and enough flexibility to be able to update and grow the project in the future  the way ieldran is designed has also given me some ideas on simplifying the back end database as well  because my dissertation work is part of a much larger research effort the structure of our organizational database is not set in stone  at the moment then the notion that i can simply upload a dataset to github in the form of a csv file is appealing  our data is currently in excel and access and is going through a process of cleaning and streamlining at the moment  rather than trying to reinvent the wheel by using a new repository such as kora it will probably make my life much simpler to be able to export data from our existing databases into a bootleaf webmap hosted on github  i believe this will be a good plan moving forward and will allow me to focus on actually creating a working website rather than banging my head against data organization and software installation troubles,
continuing with the aesop’s tale theme the banda thru time project would best be cast as the tortoise but hopefully with the same positive outcome as aesop’s protagonist by the time of our august gathering at msu scanning of images has continued and veronique plante has been placing pilot content into a wordpress template available through the uvic online academic community which will host the site we’ve been monitoring the template for its compatibility on different devices since many people in ghana access the web through smart phones i had envisioned that we would be farther along than we’ve managed to date in developing content for the heritage webpage and more particularly in setting up the repository progress has been frustrated by a pressing departmental project in which i’ve deeply involved over recent months as department chair but that particular administrative delay has a silver lining in that i arrived earlier this week in ghana where i will be consulting with banda community members regarding priority topics for the web page and seeking input on the specific images and content for the repository ideally had the distance between vancouver island and ghana been less this consultation would have happened at an early point in our project development having only a skeletal outline in hand at this point has the advantage of facilitating conversation while also providing scope for community members to suggest different or modified directions and content currently the skeletal site is configured by a half dozen topics relevant to understanding the histories of daily life  learning about the past; landscapes; feeding the family; housing the family; crafting; and ceremonies these are the frames through which we’ve shared information as part of banda research project community engagement efforts in 2011 and 2014 and it will be interesting to see if these resonate with community members today in light of changes associated with the bui hydroelectric dam which came on line in recent years and is dramatically affecting local communities equally interesting will be the new directions that community members suggest for which stay tuned! inspired by our 2015 gathering at msu and the projects of other members of our institute cohort i’m also devoting time in ghana to meeting with colleagues at the ghana national museum and the university of ghana’s department of archaeology and heritage studies to initiate conversations around the aim of developing a social sciences and humanities research council of canada partnership development grant to pilot digital heritage archives for ghana partnership development grants provide start-up funding for the development of institutional partnerships that build institutional capacity and mobilize research knowledge in accessible ways and can lead to longer-term and more substantial partnership funding i’m excited about the possibilities to build on what we’ve learned through the digital archaeology institute to work collaboratively with ghanaian colleagues to build robust research data management strategies sustainable practices of digital archiving and to contribute to ghana’s leadership in the area of digital heritage in africa the digital archaeology institute sprint is thus shaping up to be a marathon tortoise  strap on your running shoes,
after focusing attention on developing an open-source gis for one of the underwater maya sites as a test case i realized i needed to spend time on other aspects of the digital archaeology project the end product of the year-long project will be a web page that showcases the underwater maya project and includes text and visual data the theme is discovery mapping and excavation of ancient maya salt works that were submerged by sea-level rise and are now underwater i have selected paynes creek salt work 74 which has two nice rectangular wooden buildings that we have mapped and excavated along with text photos video 3d scans and spatial data on the gis i have been gathering re-formatting and organizing data for the web page field journals have been transcribed by my graduate assistant photos and videos are organized in the field by year and site so are organized the 3d scans need to be downgraded  from enormous file sizes  checked that they are water-tight and uploaded to sketchfab the gis will continue to take effort in part because i am working from an existing gis geomedia by intergraph  hexagon  in order to use the data i had to transform my utm coordinate data into longitude latitude data i did this for a test case using paynes creek salt work 35 in cartodb and it worked then i began my project site paynes creek salt work 74 which has a lot more data i have transformed the point data for the wooden posts from utm to long lat and displayed it in cartodb i need to add polygon data representing the excavation units i’m not sure how to do that there are 3 long 1m-wide transects with 12 units 15 units and 6 units respectively i digitized them in geomedia i have artifact densities by material and type for each unit and excavation level we excavated from the sea floor down in 10 cm levels to a maximum of 60 cm depth figuring out how to map transects and units and to attach the excel spreadsheet data will be an ongoing quest lsu is getting a digital repository in the fall according to credible sources i have been looking at the layout of web pages  some are text-heavy; others have nested layers of information or lists of links; a few are colorful and visually appealing with my digital still and video images 3d scans and gis spatial data i want the web page to be visually appealing although i had originally decided to use wordpress i reconsidered this choice i reviewed my notes and the courses on html css and javascript we had been assigned last summer i drew a sketch of what i want the main web page to look like with clickable links  the page will feature a photo  and perhaps a movie clip  of the snorkeling archaeologists in the center with the words underwater maya underneath i will have a series of links that tell the story  why?  significance ; how?  discovery mapping excavation 3d scanning ; what?  briquetage and wooden buildings ; where?  paynes creek national park belize ; who?  researchers    along the right side i will have links to the gis to the 3d lab and to updates along the left side i will have links to facebook twitter and other web pages i am about to start coding the subtitle of this update reflects my realization that i need to work on the various parts of my digital project in order to bring it together,
hello! my name is heather mckillop i am a maya archaeologist at louisiana state university while on sabbatical in 2004 my team and i made an unexpected discovery in a shallow salt-water lagoon in paynes creek national park on the southern coast of belize we were walking systematically in the water looking for briquetage-the pottery used to evaporate brine over fires to make salt-a basic biological necessity that was scarce at inland cities where the classic maya civilization developed between about ad 300 and 900 i had previously found and excavated four salt works in the lagoon but i wanted to see whether there were more sites that could have made a significant contribution to the salt needs at inland cities we did find briquetage we also discovered wooden posts that formed the outlines of buildings-the only known ancient maya wooden architecture although most buildings at ancient maya communities were made from wood this material has decayed in the tropical environment consequently visitors to maya sites see stone temples palaces and elite residences my previous archaeological research on the coast and cays of southern belize indicated that ancient maya sites had been submerged by sea-level rise and lay buried under mangroves or underwater-hence why we were walking in the lagoon looking for sites! the wooden structures at the paynes creek sites were preserved in peat that accumulated as red mangroves grew vertically in response to sea-level rise i realized we needed to develop new ways to locate and document the underwater sites to avoid damaging them by walking we snorkeled on research flotation devices  rfds  to locate and map wooden posts and briquetage we mapped each post and distinctive artifacts using a total station survey instrument downloading the digital data at our jungle camp in the evening to a laptop and entering it into the project gis underwater maya although well-preserved the salt-water saturated wood and pottery dried and decayed on exposure to air so we started doing 3d scans at our camp with a few objects exported for conservation under temporary export permits from the belize institute of archaeology we also made 3d printed replicas of artifacts at lsu for exhibits sharing the excitement of discovery our survey methods developed for shallow underwater sites and the finds through public lectures professional conferences and publications and press releases reaches a limited audience participating in the institute for digital archaeology provides new opportunities to share the underwater maya project with a broader public audience over this year i will develop a web-based gis where viewers can click for information and search for patterning of posts and artifacts video clips showing our methods of flotation survey and mapping will be linked to the mapslinks will also be made to still images and 3d scans of artifacts  in the accompanying text i will tell the story of the discovery and mapping as well as reporting on the finds and their significance-to our understanding of ancient maya trade and economy the impact of sea-level rise on low-lying coastal communities and the only known ancient maya wooden architecture this will be a pilot project highlighting one of the underwater salt works with the goal of expanding to other recorded sites and to ongoing field research i will collaborate with current and former lsu students who work on the archaeological project the web-based gis project will be developed in tandem with a book manuscript on the archaeological research underwater maya,
my name is judy voelker i am an associate professor of anthropology at northern kentucky university  nku  i also serve as director at the nku museum of anthropology where we strive for ways for students to understand and analyze human interactions the museum promotes cultural awareness through exhibits presentations and outreach new methods to present data on-line and to maintain collections are essential to broadening the reach of archaeological knowledge with the assistance of the institute and its group of faculty and cohorts i wish to develop an up to date web presence for the archaeological material and cultural context of objects accessioned in our museum this project will provide a public platform for understanding the fort ancient culture in northern kentucky by highlighting archaeological research and excavated material in the collections of the anthropology program and at the museum the archaeology of the region has ties to wpa projects yet remains under referenced and published this project will provide content that is easily accessible informative and housed on the web the working title is  unearthing the past  fort ancient culture archaeology and northern kentucky deliverables for this project include a website with interactive components such as an interactive map archaeological site data drawn from a database and a citizen science participatory component to understanding what archaeologists do over the past several month students and i have coordinated to digitize several hundred photographs and slides associated with archaeological excavations at two sites; the goal is to have an on-line platform for this material and a searchable database for others to use this interactive web-based project will inform both our university community as well as the broader region with information on our cultural heritage and archaeological past the intended audience is wide and includes university stakeholders and the wider community  groups such as k-12 teachers and students avocational archaeologists and people interested in the regional past i look forward to updating this blog regularly on our progress,
it's been a busy chaotic month with classes ending this week and finals beginning next; earlier this year we learned of a date change for graduation from may 7th to may 14th because in kentucky we can not  apparently  have graduation on derby day our department awards banquet is this evening and university faculty awards festivities are tomorrow all of this is preamble for very little progress on this project in the past month; one highlight though is last week we sponsored the 1st annual barbara thiel memorial lecture in archaeology over 90 students faculty and staff attended and listened to jeannine kreinbrink speak about late prehistoric cultures in northern kentucky jeannine an anthropology alumnae who owns a local crm firm; she did field school at the dunn village site as an undergraduate and it's this site which we are doing our legacy project on she is active in the community and is now working with other alumni to provide our digital project with additional photos of the field school excavations at dunn village through the years this effort has possibilities of adding another dimension of community interaction to our web presence i'll have more to add soon once the semester has ended;,
boy a year can sure go by quickly particularly when plans for a project change as you go through the process of trial and error in seeing what does or doesn’t work for the project although the project in a broader sense has moved forward considerably the digital aspect that will be presented for msudai 20 this august has not progressed as much as i might have liked however i have been trouble-shooting some issues that may have some relevance to other folks and thought i would talk about them a bit here specifically a conversation that i had with a curator from an institution that i have been working with – the canadian museum of history - showed me a significant roadblock that other projects may run into during data collection for my dissertation research i took multiple photographs of every object that was examined when i first proposed the coppermines digital atlas at msudai last year these photos were intended to be a significant portion indeed somewhat foundational to the project photographs of artifacts are one of the most tangible things that can connect research to a general audience and are central to engaging the public when discussing my project with the curator i had been working with she encouraged me to contact the museum’s copyright office to make sure that the research agreement i had signed permitted the use of the images in the way that i intended the copyright office and the cmh in general have been hugely helpful and actually made the process very easy for me to get official copyright permissions for use in my project essentially as long as i do not profit from them in any way i have full ability to share and distribute them for any academic and non-profit purposes however this experience highlighted the potential downfalls of a complex project that combines data and information from multiple institutions and organizations in the way that one designs a database and uses the information from multiple sources in essence i have realized that copyright issues and the use of data is much more complex that i had previously realized particularly when dealing with larger organizations that may need to have more stringent copyright protections for a host of other reasons for the cmh the creation of any 3d digital models is highly regulated although i was disappointed that i would not be able to experiment with digital photogrammetry it is understandable the concern that the museum has with creating 3d models of objects concerning unauthorized reproductions of artifacts and the potential for people to profit from them something which i had not previously considered an issue i also wanted to use this blog post to highlight another organization that has recently been brought to my attention that shares similar goals with msudai the eloka project  exchange for local observations and knowledge of the arctic  was recommended to me as a potential collaborator that may be interested in hosting my project in the future they share common cause with making research data available maintaining sustainable digital access to data and also fostering collaboration between researchers and arctic communities the organization of this project was one that interested me focused topically on northern issues and local traditional knowledge  ltk  they function as a support system and network hub for independent projects focused on more specific research agendas  such as environmental oral histories of snow narwhal hunting conditions etc from across the circumpolar arctic  with a focus on data availability and maintenance and sustainable relationships with northern communities they are an interesting organization and could potentially prove to be a useful partner in the future,
the crowdsourcing project for magic mountain is now complete! a huge thanks to dan pett and micropastsorg i am motivated to attempt another crowdsourcing project before august since dan helped so much with getting this last one going  i was planning on going to harvard in may to try to work on digitizing parts of the magic mountain collection there unfortunately this did not work out and i don’t think i am going to be able to make it there before we meet again in michigan in august i am heading to the field next week with high school students from the denver museum’s teen science scholar program once we return in early july the students are required to put in some time in the museum i will have them work on digitizing another aspect of the magic mountain collection we have here and work to create another crowdsourcing project before we all meet again in august  hopefully micropasts will be up for hosting magic mountain part ii on the research front we are moving forward with geophysical surveys at magic mountain the first week in august it will be really great to start actual work in the site we are generating a lot of enthusiasm around a larger community based project and are hoping to launch some component of this next fall,
after wrapping up the scans last month i have found a permanent home for the website! the permanent link will be located on the nevada department of transportation  ndot  cultural resources website with a link on the ndot cave rock shed project construction page the construction page will be retired at the end of the construction project in the fall of 2016 i'm continuing to consult with the thpo on the project and keep the photos available for review as they are incorporated into the project   =attachment_3024 style=width  2715px  alignleft>dismantling the 1860's truss bridge outside cave rock 1964 the deconstruction photos aide in digitally recreating the appearance of the surface before european contact          i've been hard pressed to coordinate so publicly on the project with the many interested parties i think that in the last six weeks i have managed to snag every project management pitfall that we discussed last august so i am very glad that ethan discussed the topic i'm hoping that things smooth out in that regard over the next few weeks,
for the last month i've been working on selecting content for the website  i gave a presentation on the archaeological research related to this project at the society for american archaeology conference in orlando florida last week  my presentation focused on the objects in the collection as well as some in-depth analysis of use-wear on socketed bone points  the presentation helped me to work on some of the visual content and text that i can use for the virtual museum  i also worked with our research partners at the university of south florida  on materials for the website  they gave me some great imagery of three different kinds of bone fish gorges found at the site  fish gorges were a common type of fishing gear among indigenous societies in north america  a fish gorge is typically pointed on both ends and is attached to a line at its midsection  once the fish swallows a baited gorge a tug on the line turns the gorge and lodges it in the fish's throat  they are a very effective and simple type of fishing gear  in modern times fish gorges are commonly used by survivalists because they are easy to make and easy to use  next month i'll continue working on content generation and i am hoping to secure permissions i need for the host site   =attachment_2968 style=width  732px  aligncenter>three forms of bone fish gorges from an archaeological site ,
last week i was out in the field but this week i'm back in the office and working away on my project  i've been trying to focus on generating content so it feels a bit like my project is composed of lots of very small projects   some of these small projects have been going slowly because i've never created things quite like this but i'm learning a lot in the process and trying to keep track of some of the solutions i've discovered while working through problems after wrestling with some challenging file export problems i've finished the video about the archaeology at the site  the video contains footage of vibracoring at the site videos and images of artifacts recovered at the site and a narration about the history of the site and the ongoing archaeological research  the lesson i learned with this micro-project was that if you start working in adobe premiere elements don't try to convert your project to adobe pro later on  elements and pro don't play nicely together at least not for what i was working on  the video premiered last week at two separate public events in everglades national park in the next month i'm going to finish selecting the individual artifacts to display in the virtual museum  i'm currently trying to work out which media will best suit each artifact class  and individual artifacts in several cases   i've worked out some organizational kinks and i've got a pretty good handle on how i want the museum navigation to flow  during the next couple of months i'll be working predominantly on generating content  once i have a good deal of material prepared then i'll shift my focus to building the website,
this past month i worked on laying the bureaucratic groundwork to get the website started  i consulted with other archaeologists and other national park service staff about what will be available on the website  i also prepared a lot of documents outlining the content navigation purpose audience etc for the website  i just submitted my request for permission to build a new national park service website for the virtual museum  when the website is approved  fingers crossed!  i will need to send in some more planning documents  i've started on all the required documents but they will need to be revised and tweaked depending on the feedback for my proposal the documentation process has helped me to articulate my goals for the virtual museum and has made me think about how i will measure success for the website  so far i've focused a lot on generating content and how i will actually make the website  it's been  nice to shift into a longer-term focus and consider what will happen after the site goes live  i came up with a prioritized schedule for making content go live  this will let me get the essential content up first and then build additional content over time next week i'll be back in the field but during the rest of the next month i'll work on my planning documents content generation and writing text  hopefully by my next post i'll have good news to share about the website permissions,
the northern indigenous copper database has been progressing well in some arenas and more slowly in others the main tasks to this point have been the organization of the data that will ultimately populate the geospatial database and decision-making regarding the level of detail to include that will allow for the successful implementation of the database in august when we reconvene for msudai part 2 at minimum i plan on including geospatial coordinates  with some degree of randomization for site security  imagery and basic metadata such as site names artifact types cultural groups and archaeological time periods  in the future  likely to be incorporated after the initial release of the project  will be a more robust search function more complete metadata and the inclusion of additional multimedia such as experimental copper working video and 3d models of artifacts  here is a small sample of the amount and variety of objects to be included;      in addition to organizing the data that will comprise the database i have been coordinating with a number of northern cultural institutions to make community consultation visits next november although this is after the database will go live the product that will be created by august will serve as a prototype to demonstrate the functionality to communities in the northwest territories and nunavut the tasks for the coming month include continuing to organize the database but more importantly to make some decisions regarding software to implement the project the leading candidate at the moment to use as a framework is the nunaliit atlas framework – a program designed for the creation of interactive and flexible web-mapping projects that has been utilized for many other northern cultural projects nunaliit relies on other specific software products for the storage and manipulation of data and multimedia files including couchdb java imagemagick and ffmpeg the next step will be to download and play with nunaliit to determine if this is the best option for me to move forward with,
my institute project is to create a virtual museum for a group of bone tools from florida  recently i spent time working with some of the digital files prepared by project partner alliance for integrated spatial technologies  aist  of the university of south florida  they prepared rotational videos of artifacts and conducted rti  reflectance transformation imaging  of some of the bone tools in the collection  rti involves photographing an object under different sources of light to enhance the visibility of features on the surface of an object  in this case i'm looking for manufacture marks on the bone surface like cut marks from stone tools or shaving marks from using shark teeth tools  i'm also looking for striations or wear patterns that might tell me how the tool was used  i've made a few videos showing how a bone is analyzed with rti  videos of the rti for particularly intriguing bone tools will be uploaded to the virtual museum  the photograph below shows four screenshots from the rti - note how the marks on the bone tool are more or less visible in each screenshot,
for the last month i've been planning the overall content and layout for the virtual museum website  i started working with a content strategy template for planning websites  the template prompted web authors to generate lists of content and lists for navigation  the template was good for helping me define goals and objectives for the website but i found that verbally describing the content i wanted on a webpage wasn't helping me envision the overall framework of the website  i felt like i needed an explicit plan for organizing the content throughout the website  i also wanted to develop a straightforward pathway to navigate through the content from page to page after trying a few different ways to lay things out i landed on powerpoint to sketch out a draft of the website  i roughed out the content for primary webpages and planned ways to link related content  seeing a mock-up of each page helped me find ways to present a coherent narrative throughout the website  creating the mock web pages has been useful for evaluating what content i need to add and what i need to simplify  it's also been helpful for determining how much material should be on each page and what should be put on separate pages  i drafted text for some of the pages and edited photographs  i made a lot of progress on the educational video i'm making about the archaeological site next month the video will be shown at a public outreach event  ultimately the video will be available on the virtual museum website looking forward i'll be spending a lot of time generating content during the next month  i have a lot of text to write and edit and i need to photograph quite a few artifacts  i'll also be conducting research on the collection in preparation for a jointly-authored presentation at the society for american archaeology meetings in april,
first off this process has been a lot harder than i expected i am running up against my own technological limitations – not just that i don’t know how to complete a particular task but that i don’t know how to describe what i’m looking for well enough to search for a tutorial or to ask for help i think this is illustrated even in my introduction to the project where i say i’m going to do certain things…they sounded right when i was typing but now i’m pretty sure they didn’t actually mean what i thought they meant i started a new position this fall and i kind of assumed i’d see what platform was available for faculty web pages and then create the behind-the-scenes structure that would work with that well six months in and we still don’t have department webpages let alone faculty webpages so rather than adapting my project to fit an existing web situation i have both the freedom and the terror of picking whatever platform i want  and this is where my technological limitations and the demands of a new job meet to make life hard  unfortunately it feels like the majority of the digital from this digital archaeology project is still pending from a data management standpoint i have fortunately made some progress these last few months i have a graduate research assistant working with me to clean up excel sheets with my dissertation data and code additional samples to fit into this database so by the time i figure out what i’m doing there should be some good data to share,
the valdivia culture of coastal ecuador dates between 4400 and 1450 bc it is one of the earliest settled and ceramic producing traditions in the americas for all this however archaeological understanding of this important time period is limited due in large part to the embryonic nature of ecuadorian archaeology particularly when compared to its neighbor to the south peru the principal goal of this project is to provide a centralized database and knowledgebase for valdivia archaeology much of the information about this time period is siloed either in gray literature or in monolingual publications that are inaccessible due to cost or restricted distribution valdivia flare rim jar from my excavations at the valdivia site of buen suceso  my idea to improve this situation by creating a bilingual web database  spanish and english  titled virtual valdivia rather than simply cataloguing publications virtual valdivia will host the data that underlays archaeological interpretation encouraging archaeologists to undertake meaningful inter-site analyses the inaccessibility of artifact databases limits our ability to build a regional understanding of the community interactions and diversity that characterize this time period the first phase of the project will focus on ceramic assemblages drawing on analysis that i undertook for my dissertation while the primary audience for this database is other archaeologists it is my hope that the richer interpretations that we can build about the past by sharing such data will help make our conclusions more accessible to a general audience,
in my last project update i think my overall tone was frustration and fear frustration because the resources that i thought i’d have institutionally weren’t forthcoming and fear because of having to deal with the technology in a more tangible way i’m happy to say that this post is much more optimistic in the last month i finally buckled down and started making the website this will serve as the public face of the project and also allow access to query the database after suggestions from my msudai mentors i built it using bootstrap a responsive website framework there are some pretty comprehensive tutorials online that help you build your pages and work with the bootstrap features once i got a look at the logic of the system it was pretty easy to customize my page right now it’s stored on github  http   sarahmrowegithubio virtual_valdivia   and it looks very pretty if i do say so myself i pulled the color scheme from the tones of the pottery as well as the subtropical forest environment where they were found front and center is a near-complete vessel that i recovered during excavations for my dissertation i started the website process by creating a navigational map you know right on paper in hard form first and foremost in my mind was that i wanted to have content in english and spanish i decided that the easiest way to do this to have parallel pages accessed through the header bar right now the only page that has real content is the home page but the structure is there for the other pages my goal is to have some reference material about the valdivia culture more generally and then have specific sections about each of the reference collections and the sites where materials came from i also have a news panel which is where i’ll announce additions to the database or other milestones that we reach skills attained     familiarity with the bootstrap systemgoals reached     created structure for web presence  goals remaining     build query function for the databasemobile version of the website  =attachment_2720 style=width  310px  alignleft>full-screen website          ,
the purpose of this project is to create a web-based deliverable that will enhance community interest in local heritage the site of interest is located in the pinelands of new jersey  i am still working out the details with the project partners at this time until a final agreement is settled between myself and all the project partners i can not reveal the site name or location  however i can tell you a few things about the design of the project the hope is that this project will result in a web-based museum that will offer a customized tour experience for the user users will receive an option of completing either an archaeology tour or an architectural tour the tour of the structure will include a series of photographs or images of the interior historical maps and artifacts the archaeological tour will guide the visitor through an archaeological excavation and the interpretation process users will complete the tour within twenty minutes and will be redirected to the second tour at the conclusion of their first tour selection users can return to the website and participate in the second tour at their leisure static pages will provide information about previous archaeology projects at the site and site specific history  a selection of programs will be used to build the website and enhance the user's experience the website will consist of twine html css java and geojson coding respectfully i would like to create an interactive map of the property to show the user locations of various outbuildings that used to be on the property  due to security reasons the map may be restricted if this portion of the project is approved mapbox will be used to create an interactive map tagging various points of interest on the landscape as they relate to the history of the tavern users will interact with this website on either a wordpress or bootstrap platform server hosting is currently being negotiated project updates will be provided on various social media platforms including  facebook twitter and pinterest  i have feature creep concerns given i have never used twine before and it seems as though i can do quite a lot design wise this will be very tempting! i am currently trying to determine who will host the finished product i have been told it will likely be hosted by one of the partners although i am concerned about whether i will be granted server access or if they have enough server space to spare this project will likely require a lot of space for video and photos i offered matrix as an alternative option i plan to reach out to the primary partner tomorrow and set up a meeting with the head supervisor who would be my point of contact for this project if the primary partner approves my project-pitch then i can continue working on this project until then i plan to enhance my skills in javascript and jquery i will also begin building the narrative for one of the twine tours i plan to offer stay tuned for developments,
the past three month have passed quickly and unfortunately i haven't accomplished much towards creating my taraco peninsula webmapping project although i haven’t done as much work on creating the actual website yet i have been spending a lot of time reading writing and thinking about the people and landscapes of the taraco peninsula - particularly through writing grant proposals and working on my book all of this work has given me ideas of what i should include in the website and has reinforced the need for it as we begin the next phase of our field work on the peninsula this summer i spent the past few months mostly playing around with some of the programs and tools that i learned about in the institute that i think can be used for make my webmapping project  some of them have even helped me with other projects i’ve been working on!   the first task i set out to do was gather all of the various sources of spatial data about the peninsula that the taraco archaeological project has accumulated in its 20+ years of existence we’ve had several individuals acquire publicly available spatial data such as digital elevation models and satellite imagery the project has also created many maps of archaeological sites and the surrounding areas i now have a wealth of spatial imagery and so my next goal is to figure out which of these might be most useful for my website and how i convert them into formats amendable to being integrated into the website one of the reasons i want to do this is because although places like google earth mapbox and cartodb have some great looking maps they don't contain all of the information i need like roads and town names or information such as soil or vegetation types i discovered this in my early exploration of the programs i thought might be useful for my project i started by examining the project i mentioned in my first blog post ieldran which katy meyers developed by modifying a webmapping template called bootleaf developed by bryan mcbride i began by looking through her code on github and whoa! she made some pretty substantial changes to bootleaf which are well beyond my capabilities and time availability i also realized my project is a bit different than katy’s because while i do hope to have data points with information  as she does for different types of mortuary remains  she uses one single basemap and i want to use at least two  going to be conservative to start but hopefully more eventually   i then turned to the program mapbox which brian geyer taught us about at the institute it has several different base maps built in that look quite nice two of which i include here i started a project for the peninsula using the most basic tools i even tried to import some data points  utm coordinates of archaeological sites  and plot them on the base map the points did not end up on the peninsula i’m not sure what i did wrong but i also didn’t spend much time investigating  =attachment_2556 style=width  310px  alignnone>satellite image of the taraco peninsula bolivia created in mapbox  =attachment_2557 style=width  310px  alignnone>topographic map of the taraco peninsula bolivia created in mapbox  in exploring mapbox though i realized that i would actually like to have more control over what the look and information available on the base map this lead me to explore another program that came up several times in the institute  qgis the taraco archaeological project has several arcgis projects that different individuals developed for theses and other smaller projects since i’m a mac user and generally like the idea of open source programs i downloaded qgis and began to fiddle with it i didn’t get very far though! in reading the posts today i’m happy to see that megan perry has gone through a similar process so i plan to seek her help in creating base images that can be placed into mapbox  which she is using  or other webmapping programs one of my mentors brian geyer suggested that i try leaflet because it provides good tools for creating clickable items on maps that direct people to pages with additional information i haven’t explored it yet but plan to do so as i move forward after watching the past three months fly by i also took some time to create a timetable and workflow in order to make sure that i stay on task in the coming months i’ll be doing fieldwork in bolivia in june and july and so need to have the basics of the website done by then this will give me the opportunity to test it out there with our bolivian collaborators i hadn’t really thought about the website from the perspective of mobile devices but i think that might actually be the most important in order to make this a useful site to make me even more accountable i’m going to share with you all my goal for february!  -create the homepage for the website  this will include the initial view of peninsula mostly likely a satellite image with roads and the names of the main communities and known places of interest  it will include the basic design elements  fonts layout  and some of the most basic information about the site and place with this complete i can then begin to create the elements that visitors will be able to explore through this initial portal,
with my goal for this month being to create the homepage for my website i set out to work on it i first contacted the folks at dickinson who help faculty set up webpages and got a thumbs up for being able to host it there they were new to bootleaf  which i had proposed to use in my vision document  but determined that it would be compatible with their system i don’t have a domain name yet but when i have something concrete to share with them i hope to be able to establish it next was to design the site i was hoping that i’d be able to share the start of my site in this post but as usual it turned out to be harder than i thought it would be! as i mentioned in my previous post i had momentarily ruled out using katy meyer’s modification of bootleaf i got some great feedback from my mentors especially brian geyer and explored some options for creating a site in github and bootstrap when i realized that i’d have to build everything from scratch i decided to give bootleaf another look  also with some nudging from ethan  i think the first time i read through katy’s code i was getting too bogged down in the details of font types when i returned to it and compared her webpage to the basic bootleaf i realized that i could have multiple map layers  one of my initial concerns  and that her commented_ieldran code in github is actually really helpful and not so scary after all brian and ethan also pointed me back to github and using gh-pages to review the webpage in a browser as i create it  something we learned in the institute and i had forgotten  so into github i went! it seems like such a simple program  and it really is  but i had the hardest time just trying to figure out basic things like copying a folder from one repo into another or actually editing code in the desktop version of github thankfully brian came to my rescue on numerous occasions and pointed me in the right direction  you can check out some of my questions and his replies on the commons page you can also follow my repo paisajes on github  i had many moments of deep despair when trying to figure out what seemed to be the simplest tasks today in fact in trying to delete a branch from my repo i ended up deleting the whole repo!! thankfully all of my work had been saved in the github desktop folder on my computer i made a copy of it just to be sure and then used the new skills i learned this week to recreate it  creating the new repo in github online opening it up in the desktop github  i had to also delete the earlier version there first which was scary  copying all of the files from the initial repo into the desktop version and then syncing it with the on-line repo it worked i felt victorious! needless to say i do not yet have the paisajes webpage to share but i have started to modify the text in my forked version of katy’s commented_ieldran speaking of which i also created a read me documents in my github giving attribution to katy and bootleaf and i included her license document to be sure i give credit where credit is due! now that i have a working repo and know how to edit in the desktop  this was not easy to figure out - you have to edit in a text edit file and then sync it!  my goal is to replace katy’s maps of great britain with those of the taraco peninsula i will also have most of the text changed i would like to redesign the look of the page and will have different types of tabs and tasks but baby steps given that i’ve been spending so much time with github i though i’d share this guardian article that came out last week looking at gender dynamics in the world of coding based on data from github as so many such studies show there is a bias against women  their repos are less commented on used  when the gender of the creator is apparent where creator’s gender was not obvious women’s repos showed more activity than men’s leading the authors to suggest that women are excellent - the best even - coders i’m clearly not one of them but they inspire me -mari,
"how can i use a controlled vocabulary for metadata and still convey the complexity and uncertainty of cappadocian monuments? this is at the heart of my msudai project and much of my digital work as a whole underscoring this issue is the need for transparency when making decisions about cultural heritage documentation while maintaining that open data is on the whole a positive thing archivist mark matienzo recently argued that we need to critically examine the practice of applying names labels and schema to consider the communities involved he describes naming as an assertion of power his argument echoes tim sherratt who recently wrote access will never be open every csv is an expression of power every api is an argument citing the archives a platform to promote ethics preserving the past while recognizing a responsibility to point out the shortcomings in our methods he continues digital tools enable us to see things differently – to demystify the secret to expose patterns and trends locked up in tables statistics or cultural collections sherratt then addsmanaging expectations  or why the wheel is fine how it is """,
my last post had a fairly depressing tone as i struggled to figure out how to take my spreadsheet data and create a framework to allow people to access it i'd had my eye on the data organization structure of open context since i first heard about it at the 2015 saas but for some reason had never just talked to eric about hosting the data there i guess for some reason i thought i had to do it all myself? i finally hit bottom after that last blog post in terms of feeling like a reasonably capable human being and i reached out to eric to discuss what i was trying to do turns out he can totally host my data on open context and then i can use their api with my website so that people can pull records so here's one really good lesson i've learned in this process  you don't have to reinvent the wheel has someone already developed a system that will let you do what you need to do? then partner with them  =attachment_3094 style=width  565px  aligncenter>virtual valdivia is up in open context  i did a few data conversion things  transforming number codes to text descriptors thanks openrefine  and sent eric the database he got it up pretty quickly and then i learned my second lesson  no matter how clean you think your data is there are always things to tweak we've gone back and forth a bit and things are getting there but i think i still need to add one or two hierarchies so that the data sorts out in a logical way the next and most important step was preparing a document for all the metadata and object descriptors so people browsing the site will know what things mean that document will be about 20 pages when it's all said and done that step was a nice reminder for me that digital projects still involve a lot of the traditional activities that we're accustomed to  like writing  i still need to add a few more sections of information for that but it's getting added to oc bit by bit my next steps are ,
